This article is a part of my 30 days challenge "One Problem A Day". Where I have to solve a problem I have through my day. Today: ** What can I do when i'm bored? **

<!-- more -->

That's pretty funny given all the things I can do in life that we achieve being in a state of bored no? Is being bored something that animals feel or only humans? Ok let's come up with 10 things I can do.

1. Write anything on anything. You never know what you might come up with
2. Send a message to somebody you want to meet. Or better call an old acquaintance
3. Take some time to breathe
4. Make a to do of what I need to do before leaving
5. Run / exercice
6. Read
7. Clean my room / organize my stuff. I think the act of organizing physically something have the same effect on your mind somehow !
8. Wow it start to be hard after 7... Cook? (I usually never cook)
9. OH I HAVE A GOOD ONE ! Ask myself if i'm heading to the right direction for my life.
10. Do something, anything but do something.
