There are different types of experiences.

<!-- more -->


There are certain experiences that cannot be shared to people like the the act to love.

And certain experiences that can only be shared with someone like love.

And finally there are experiences that can be great alone but with the right person would be FAB-ULOUS.

Thank to those people in my life who make good experiences great.
