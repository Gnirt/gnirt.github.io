We had a 4 days workshop at [Gobelins](http://www.gobelins.fr/), having fun making 3D and animation. You can see the result at [http://philippetring.fr/Three-js-experimentation/](http://philippetring.fr/Three-js-experimentation/ "Three js experimentation")

For the inspiration the first part is a Spoken Word (a form of poetry) originally perform by Prince EA. The second part is from Matrix, the movie.

Let me know what you think in the comments, criticism more than welcome.
