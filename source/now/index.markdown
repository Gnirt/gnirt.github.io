Currently living in Paris, preparing for a not so little cycling on earth after I graduate from school

# Things I'm quitting

1. Porn
2. Video game

# Those are what I'm focusing on

1. Eating healthy, eat junk food maximum once a week and drinking a lot of water
2. Train for martial arts at least twice a week and morning work out (40 push ups and 2 minutes stretching)
3. Being a good friend and family member, being there for them and ready to listen
4. Writing, simply 10 minutes a day
