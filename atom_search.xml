<p>Why is it that in periods of travelling we always end up meeting tons of people?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>3 November 2016 is the beginning of my trip in the USA for the first time, I basically spent the day in airports, my itinerary included 2 connections to my final destination at Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>Airport can be lonely or boring, but it was the total opposite, I’ve met more strangers (What a funny word, we are all strange in our ways) in one day than during a week or month in my usual days.</p>

<p>The first one was an Asian-German Stewart with long hair. I was checking my on-boarding ticket and told him I liked his hair, of course, there were a few seconds of awkwardness then he had this embarrassed smile and told me thank you. He gave me back my ticket and show me his fist for a fist bump. I felt cool in the eyes of the other people waiting behind.</p>

<p>Then I met a Roman guy who immigrated in 1995 in United State and who now live in Alaska. He really got me excited to visit Alaska once. At first he looked very vulgar he had his arm crossed during the whole flight, a lot of muscle and big. He tried to get some free beer with the attendant. I was reading my book “On Writing Well” and he asks me if I was going to study in the USA. He had like a lot of immigrants such an interesting story on how he came from Romania.</p>

<p>The last but not least person was a wise Indian woman who did not speak a word of English (That’s good, because so do I). So all the words I or she said would always end up with simple gaze at each other then smiles. And that was more than enough to communicate. I help her with her bag, her seatbelt, and proposed her some “Date” (It’s a fruit, can&rsquo;t find the word in English)</p>

<p>Is it my everyday behavior that doesn’t enough show openness for me to meet people?</p>

<p>The key to meeting people is in vulnerability.</p>

<p>You see, when my friend Brett picked me up, we had a big manly hug (OK… He just crashed me with all his strength). Then something incredible happened, I felt awkward and very happy at the same time.</p>

<p>Just to give you a bit of background I had the chance to meet Brett in a train to an airport, he was travelling with his wife in Paris. We had a 30 minutes small talk then we ended up exchanging contact. Then we wrote to each other for 3 years. Which led us back to this hug.</p>

<p>I felt very happy, like seeing a school best friend I haven’t seen for decades. But my first reaction was telling this joke: “Give me a hug because I’m cold, not because I like you”. And thinking back on this I think it was my default state of “Hide yourself in your funny shell to don’t show how great you feel”. Because that would mean showing weakness and vulnerability in some ways.</p>

<p>All my interactions of the day had to do with showing vulnerabilities and truth. Not just my title “Hello I’m Philippe a developer”. But showing aspect of me that are “vulnerable” or another way to say it : “authentic”.</p>

<p>The four stages of ego.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>1 &ndash; Dependent</h1>

<p>We all start at the same point. The genesis of our life, born from a womb we can’t move, can’t feed ourselves, and can’t survive. As the years goes by we develop physical attributes we walk, speak, learn to eat without anyone. But at the same time we develop attachment to people’s attention, our parents, brother, sister, closest people in our environment. And we see TV’s, magazines with heroes. They are strong, intelligent and known by everyone “Footballer”, “Superman”, “Beyonce”, or even genius “Elon Musk”.</p>

<p>We crave for the fame, we need to do something special. Because everybody does something incredible. We judge ourselves badly because we are not enough. We are dependent on people expectation our parents, our friends first. Or so we think.</p>

<p>Our ego needs people validation and approval.</p>

<h1>2 &ndash; Independent</h1>

<p>Then something clicks and we start being independent. We start thinking for ourselves. Being strong emotionally. Being enough for ourselves. Maybe it takes 20, 30, 40, 50 years or maybe it never happens. It’s hard to think for ourselves taking away external stimuli. I know I’m still fighting every day to get out of the dependent zone. It’s a lifelong battle.</p>

<p>Each step in that direction is a pity, but one day you woke up and look back and you are proud. You do not obsess making billions of dollars, having tons of clothes, being recognized by everyone, or with finding the one in order to find happiness. You start to know yourself being content with your own body, spirit and ultimately feeling joy hanging out with yourself.</p>

<p>Our ego slowly finds harmony and gets okay with our own presence</p>

<h1>3 &ndash; Interdependent</h1>

<p>Then you are ready to make the big leap. You shine and people can feel it. You feel good, you make people feel good around you. I know that feeling, I’ve encountered dozens of people literally shining. The French word would be “avenant” all I can think of as a translation in English is &ldquo;warm&rdquo;. We’ll get there sooner or later. Might take a bit of patience or should I say a lifelong of patience?</p>

<p>Funny how in order to be close to people we first need to take a step back. Grow, then come back and find true ally. Because alone we&rsquo;ll never get as far as together.</p>

<p>But we can only progress forward with people who are ready to do so too. Bring an independent ego with a dependent one will only make the dependent even more craving for the attention of the independent.</p>

<p>Our ego is ready to see the light in other ego, we can all shine together, without any of us requiring more lighting.</p>

<h1>4 &ndash; Nothing</h1>

<p>And then comes a time when you have the ultimate ha-ha moment. Our ego is nothing compared to the universe and we are such a small and fragile creature. I always get that feeling when vagabonding in the wild. Being at bottom of a giant mountain, seeing miles and miles a far on the peak of it. Looking at the infinity of stars or trying to see life as a 200-year-old tree.</p>

<p>We see things in perspective, we are small and our time here is so small.</p>

<p>But if ultimately we are nothing… What’s the point of this journey? That’s right, we might disappear in the next second or next decades. So what should we do?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t wait. Don&rsquo;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody&rsquo;s life. Clean up a neighborhood park. Be a mentor. Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody&rsquo;s life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one. If you have something to give, give it now, because that’s all we really have &ldquo;now&rdquo;. So get in the game.</p>

<p>I haven’t written for quite some time… To be honest I felt like my reason to write was… Craving for attention. That’s what we do in today’s world, we all seek attention in a way or in another. All that Facebook, like me or like I call it temple to yourself. This is the same thing I’m doing here on that blog. Look at it, I even called it by my name. I had this epiphany a few months ago. And it stuck with me ever since. But where is the border between egoism and altruism? The act to share a so so valuable perspective without bragging. This is when I came up with the theory of evolution of ego.</p>

<p>Thank you all the kind messages I got when I wasn’t writing. If you want to connect drop me a line at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#112;&#x68;&#x69;&#108;&#x69;&#112;&#112;&#101;&#x74;&#114;&#105;&#x6e;&#103;&#x40;&#103;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;&#x2e;">&#x70;&#104;&#x69;&#108;&#105;&#x70;&#x70;&#101;&#x74;&#x72;&#105;&#110;&#x67;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;&#x2e;</a> You don’t need to come up with something elaborate just &ldquo;hi&rdquo; !</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>Picture was taken during a playful afternoon in England at my first movement class by <a href="http://www.benmedder.com/">Ben Medder</a>. First classes are always a challenge for the ego, where you have to surrender old habits and perspective to be able to learn in a state of beginners.</p>

    <id>http://philippetring.fr/blog/2016/04/02/why-i-suck-at-smartphones</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/why-i-suck-at-smartphones.jpg"></p>

<p>I just ended a whole month without a smartphone. My relationship with cellphones has always been an “it’s complicated” one. I had my first phone at 18, a dumb one until 22 and finally got a smartphone when my coworkers gave me a one out of despair. And even now, with this awesome piece of technology in my pocket I still don&rsquo;t have an internet plan.</p>

<p>If anyone is proud with the last iPhone, I personally used to show off to the fact that I don’t own a one. I hate smartphones.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>While traveling I realize a paradox. People in big cities tend to attach much more importance to their connecting device than people who live in more secluded area. Also long term travelers spend time sightseeing while short-term traveler capture moments. The correlation between smartphone use and time/distance is just wrong ! Smartphone is just a layer on the real world.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t always blame it on smartphones. It’s the tendency I have to watch it&rsquo;s screen rather than my friend’s eyes when I’m at a dinner. It’s pretty hard nowadays to just be alone, I am so uncomfortable with myself. I wasn’t able few years ago to just shut everything and speak with myself. No earphone, no computer, no smartphone, no screen, me and me alone. Reflecting internally, and taking the time to ask big questions.</p>

<p>At the end. It’s not about denying smartphones. It’s about consciousness and mindfulness. When I sit on a table with or without a device I can still be a million miles away in my head OR be present and here with the people around me. I also can&rsquo;t deny how many opportunities of bounding to people all over the world smartphone open.</p>

<p>Smartphone I love you, it’s just my self-control that I hate.</p>

<p>Ps: Freshly quoted from one of my emails today, “Tonight, I have my phone backkkkk!&#8221;</p>

    <id>http://philippetring.fr/blog/2016/03/13/dont-be-fearless</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/dont_be_fearless.jpg"></p>

<p>Last night, I read &ldquo;The End of The Night&rdquo; a book about light pollution from artificial lighting. While reading it I remember a little story from my childhood. My old brother had some friends over for the night and they were watching a horror movie. It was way too scary and I wanted to go to sleep but the corridor was dark. I asked my brother to come with me but he and his friends made fun of me. I ended up with two choices, keep watching the horror movie or go into the dark, full of my imaginary bogeyman.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>I Will Never Be Fearless</h1>

<p>I heard that all the time. Be fearless. Like nothing can stop you. Live your life to the fullest and what if I’m full of fear? Sorry but I am. I’m afraid. Afraid of so many things. Will my English be good enough? I am good enough? Can I do it?</p>

<p>There are two types of fear.</p>

<ul>
<li>Biological fear, it’s the one that helps us survive millions of years, that tell us to run in front of a predator and also trigger an automated step back when my mum eyebrow goes angry.</li>
<li>Rational fear, it’s the one we inflict to ourselves when we are afraid of speaking in public, basically everything we are afraid of doing when it won’t have survival consequences and mostly fear based on education from society.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here I’m speaking about the rational one. So please don’t try to beat the fear from falling from 20 meters high.</p>

<h1>Fear That Stop You</h1>

<p>Your heart pound, there&rsquo;s a butterfly in your stomach. You can feel it right? The Fear. I do too. Probably more than everyone else, at least that’s what everyone thinks ! I agree, it sucks. So I stay here waiting for the right moment, I make excuses and soon enough follow avoidance, procrastination and insecurity. I feel like I stop living when I don’t confront my fears. We are born afraid of darkness. Light is the new norm but back in the day people had gaslight which was less brighter than today light. Even before we had fire light and at the start we had stars and simply moon reflection. What I mean is, even physically we don’t know darkness, we are born in the light. Look I’m typing in front of a screen lighted by led.
I’ve never enjoyed a sky full of stars in total darkness, it’s not too late. I wasn’t born knowing how to face my fears, it’s not too late. Be hopeful don’t stop here because you hadn’t done it, it’s not too late.</p>

<h1>Fear Push You Forward</h1>

<p>If I want to live fully. I should be scared as shit of life ! Your heart should be full of doubt and fear but still taking that backpack and travelling. Still going to the unknown and confront those fears. So instead of being fearless which is totally impossible. Embrace your darkness, know yourself, your strength, your weakness, your dream, and YOUR FEAR.</p>

<p>Embrace fear. Know fear. Know that fear only is a cycle. Someday you are scared as shit then the next day you feel relieved of such a burden, nothing can stop the monster in you. Like a night which is always followed by a day. Like a yin-yang kind of thing. Nothing is permanent, everything changes, so do I.</p>

<p>Fear only exists if love exists both can’t be separate in your life. Nobody is fearless, fight your today fear will only bring bigger fear to destroy. Sometimes you’ll have to face the same fear over and over. Or being stuck in a fake artificial light (your comfort zone) away from darkness. Fear is intimidating, yet instead of having a feeling of impossible let’s be inspired, motivated even excited by it. The more I’ll face it the more I expect him to come. Eventually I can’t wait for the next day to bring his fears.</p>

    <img class="iframe-ratio" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKhI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/>
    <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/F157geaXp_w" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
</div>


<p>Embrace darkness. Like bane be moulded by your fear. You’ll be a full human when you get out of your fear and let your fear go because it belong to nothing more than your head.</p>

<h1>Fear Keeps You Out of Your Comfort Zone</h1>

<p>The moment you take your friends for granted you are doomed. Be afraid to loose them. Last night I was taking the tramway to go back home and saw someone hit at by a car. Let’s not take life for granted. Hades can show up at anytime.</p>

<p>I wish you fear in your life a lot of it and depression too. Sounds mean? But it’s out of love. It makes us grow. Fear is an opportunity, an opportunity to evolve and grow. In fact this post was at first just an entry in my journal that I rewrote. Writing down things really helps even if I’m scared of how people will react. Might be helpful to someone else. You never know.</p>

<p>Best fears in your journey.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/step_back.jpg"></p>

<p>So it’s saturday night and I’m doing nothing. Like absolutely nothing. At first I was a bit empty. Like nothing is going on tonight come on I’m 23. Ain&rsquo;t I suppose to have the time of my life for god sake.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>step back</h1>

<p>It’s like a painting, if I watch it closely i’ll only see a bunch of color or maybe even a single color. But if I step back I can see the whole beauty of it.</p>

<p>So when the time come and I feel like i’m not having the time of my life. Step back and see the whole painting. On my day, my life, i’m having it. The time of my life. This moment, everything that did and do happen is awesome.</p>

<p>So now instead of stepping back from a painting what if I step back from me?</p>

<p>Because the beautiful painting I want to see is actually nobody else than me. I remember this week being upset because I was going to get in the train. When the guy just ahead of me was stepping in. He then stop moving instead of going further so people can go inside too (Please tell me that annoy you too !)</p>

<p>But that’s trying to change someone I have no direct control over. I’m trying to change something outside. But reflecting back the guy who was actually following me into the train got in the same situation as I because I was also stopping once i&rsquo;m in the train.</p>

<p>Step back and see myself as a third person because at the end that’s the thing I can change the most.</p>

<p>Now that I have step back I can judge myself according to my own belief. Would I try to be friend with myself? Would I like the painting i’m seeing (me in case you haven’t follow).</p>

<p>Once I find myself. The self I believe is good then maybe… Just maybe&hellip; I will be able to change mankind to… Kind man</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>Picture is a wall painting took at Bilbao in Spain. Imaging you zooming in the front of the shoe only. Way less beautiful, right?</p>

    <link href="http://philippetring.fr/blog/2016/01/17/vision-and-goal-at-lululemon/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-17T14:24:32+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippetring.fr/blog/2016/01/17/vision-and-goal-at-lululemon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/vision-and-goals.jpg"></p>

<p>Two days ago I had the opportunity to attempt the vision and goals workshop at Lululemon.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Vision and goal</h1>

<p>Basically, you get to hangout with a lot of people who want to be a better version of themselves, you get some time to discover what’s important to you, all that in 2 hours ! They provide a set of exercices to make:</p>

<ul>
<li>You write the 8 first values that come to your mind that define you.</li>
<li>Mark them from a scale to 0 to 10 to see how driven by them you are and where you need to refocus.</li>
<li>List all the things you want and the things you don’t want in your life.</li>
<li>Visualize a day in 10 years from now with a guided meditation (which i really liked)</li>
<li>Set career, health and personal goal</li>
<li>Set goals in 10, 5 and 1 year from now</li>
</ul>


<p>So the first part vision is to make you visualize what you want while the second part are the triggers of your imagination !</p>

<p>So overall it was great. Even though I find it difficult speaking in front of so many people (I love speaking one on one but group dynamics is really something I need to work on). I would have preferred to be grouped as pair. Which would had create personal connexion between people and more involved. (It&rsquo;s also easier to confess dreams to one that to a whole assembly)</p>

<p>To find out more check the Lululemon blog
<a href="http://blog.lululemon.com/vision-goals-why-we-love-them-and-how-to-get-started/">http://blog.lululemon.com/vision-goals-why-we-love-them-and-how-to-get-started/</a></p>

<h1>What happened to me</h1>

<p>I had one big epiphany during the visualization. So here I was trying to visualize the 10 year older me. At first I saw&hellip; NOTHING… But then they ask us the question &ldquo;How do you feel in that 10 years from now day?”. My first answer was of course: Happy. Then as my eyes were close I changed the feeling from happy to peaceful.</p>

<p>Peaceful to me is the ability to keep calm and serene as the flow of moments pass. Being able to remain like water, embracing what happen and evolve to a form while still being water. Like the water shape to adapt to his context. Be me in every context or something like this (I admit it is kind of a weird concept)</p>

<p>So I want to be peaceful in 10 years from now. But as I was thinking about this something else came up, something BIG. <strong><em>Peace is already in me</em></strong>, somewhere. It won’t come from outside like having a house, money, traveling, clothes, friend, spouse. But from inside. All I need is making it blossom more and more until it became the default state. Don’t get me wrong those things are still nice to have but they are not mandatory to happiness and inne peace.</p>

<p>So what action will I do to progress toward inner peace?</p>

<ul>
<li>To the question &ldquo;how are you&rdquo; i’ll answer : “I am happy and peaceful”. This idea is inspired by Meng (<a href="http://www.mengstupiditis.com/2011/10/how-am-i-i-am-happy-and-at-peace.html">http://www.mengstupiditis.com/2011/10/how-am-i-i-am-happy-and-at-peace.html</a>)</li>
<li>Every morning i’ll practice visualizing me reacting calm to “bad” stimulus</li>
</ul>


<p>The 10 year vision is still cloudy or i’m too afraid to face it. All I can imagine is being a martial art teacher and help people having a better health.</p>

<p>My 1 year goal are pretty easy to see. I’ll be feeling the world on my bike and make a 60 seconds handstand in a year.</p>

<p>All that being said, existentialism is a dangerous thing, I need to find a balance in my thinking and action taking. Back to work, spanish podcast and handstand training time !</p>

<p>PS: That was not a sponsored post, I just love Lululemon&rsquo;s culture</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/value-transparence.jpg"></p>

<blockquote><p>Write down what you STAND FOR on this planet.  Find it, breathe it, live it.  If you were to die tomorrow you would know that this body, this life was not in vain as you stood for this purpose through all obstacles.  You stood ALL IN on life.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is part of my manifesto, values that I follow. Somewhere I can go to and refer in case I&rsquo;m having trouble making decisions.</p>

<p>The first value is: <strong><em>Be Brutally Honest</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>To me, I&rsquo;ll be courageous enough to live a life true to myself, not the life others expect of me</li>
<li>To others, I&rsquo;ll strive for an open communication by listening, understanding only then responding with honesty</li>
<li>In action, I&rsquo;ll act my words and live my acts</li>
</ol>


<!-- more -->


<h1>To me, I&rsquo;ll be courageous enough to live a life true to myself, not the life others expect of me</h1>

<p>What does it mean to be honest, real or true? True, true to myself first of all. My desires, my goals and what I really want out of this life, my life.</p>

<p>How many time I have been delusional about a situation? Hoping for the best without taking the actions to change the output. Instead taking a passive stance, waiting to see what will happen. It&rsquo;s so much easier to let thing happen. From the moment we are born until being a young adult, every things has been taken care of.</p>

<p>For most of us the first 20 years are pretty set from the beginning. Or what I mean is it doesn&rsquo;t count on us being responsible for our lives but rather our parents or whoever is responsible for us. Life will eventually flow. But then we discover a lot of things we were protected from. Like Buddha who lived peacefully in his secular place and then discover sickness, old age and death.</p>

<p>In a much smaller way for us. That moment is generally the end of school, but school doesn&rsquo;t teach us much about love, financial independence, confidence, social skills, but certainly a lot about how to be a job and fit to society. Find ONE job and keep there until retirement so we can finally take the time to do what we want.</p>

<p>So how does the brutally come from? Brutally because it takes a lot of guts to confront facts, it&rsquo;s never easy. Especially since I am born super lucky in a rich country. I shouldn&rsquo;t have anything to complain about, there&rsquo;s no bomb dropping next to my house, I have so much water that I can pee in it, and enough food to pick and refuse some of it. But being brutally honest, is it a reason to not live this life to the fullest and accept a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; life? There will be no replay to this life. So I will make the most I can of it.</p>

<blockquote><p>A free man is free to acknowledge his fears, without hiding them, or hiding from them. &ndash; The way of the superior man</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the time it&rsquo;s social fear (and not biological one) that stop me from doing what I want. Acknowledge the fear, face it, confront it, live at his edge, then be brutal to fear, push it. Fear will never go away. I&rsquo;ll always have to fight it back. It&rsquo;s a life long war, an everyday battle. Like talking to a stranger, speaking in public, going on adventures. Basically getting in a position where I can fail will make me anxious. Even if I&rsquo;ve done it before, it&rsquo;s just less here or I simply know better how to deal with it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Build YOUR dream even if you get sidetracked helping others build theirs. Never lose sight of what YOU want. NEVER give up.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t blame people for me taking the wrong direction. When facing problem do not delay them and act upfront to find a solution instead of waiting for a sign from destiny. Be responsible, I can&rsquo;t control everything that happen but I&rsquo;m in full control of how I react.</p>

<h1>To others, I&rsquo;ll strive for an open communication by listening, understanding only then responding with honesty</h1>

<p>The previous part was about being true to my inner me. But on the outer side authenticity apply aswell.</p>

<p>Tough things is: Be honest with someone, even when I know it may hurt. I mean not angry honest. I mean sincere, sensitive honest. In my view, I owe it to the person. Have a frank conversation about the other person&rsquo;s shortcomings or mine and how it impact me, tell them how I feel and do it as early as possible.</p>

<p>The benefit is that I don&rsquo;t have to think so much about what previous lie I did say. It become less of a burden overtime. It&rsquo;s hard to be honest but overall the calm in my mind is much more rewarding. Not having to think about what I said before to X to be congruent with my past lie. Not having to make 3 hours of assumptions. After a few experiment I see people reacting much better to honesty than I hoped. People are though. The ones who react in a bad way are the one who feel insecure and can&rsquo;t handle being wrong often. That also filter people I don&rsquo;t want to hang out with.</p>

<p>I also know something is wrong if I have to lie about it. Everything I do, every choices I make, I want to be proud or at least have no fear of telling them. Maybe my choices will be the wrong decision but I don&rsquo;t want to have to hide them. When I know my life ain&rsquo;t got no secrets I&rsquo;ll be more likely to make morally good decision</p>

<p>I can see a few cases where the full transparency guidelines don&rsquo;t apply. Most obvious example is if someone tell me to keep a secret, I will.</p>

<h1>In action, I&rsquo;ll act my words and live my acts</h1>

<p>Honesty also mean not saying I&rsquo;ll do something and not doing it. Saying i&rsquo;ll introduce someone to someone, I often found a pattern where I keep saying &ldquo;Oh you have to read this&rdquo;. Then I never lend the book. Everytime I&rsquo;m conscious I&rsquo;m doing that I popup evernote or calendar and add a note to remind me to do it. Do what you promise. Follow up with my words, that way i&rsquo;ll be more aware of what I say. Another benefit is I won&rsquo;t commit to things I&rsquo;m not going to do. Or be brutally honest and tell people I don&rsquo;t want to do it. But don&rsquo;t leave people wondering what will happen next.</p>

<p>Another area where it applies is being late, nowadays nobody show up on time and that&rsquo;s crazy ! Everytime someone is late I feel like he is saying my time is more precious than yours. I can make you wait for me. And the lost, what a lost ! It&rsquo;s linear, imagine a group of 7 if one of them make the rest wait 10 minutes it&rsquo;s 60 minutes lost. The more i&rsquo;m on time the more people are going to be on time because they know i&rsquo;ll be on time. But just in case always have a book ready when I wait</p>

<blockquote><p>To me ultimately martial arts means honestly expressing yourself. &ndash; Bruce lee</p></blockquote>

<p>What Bruce Lee wanted to say through this quote is that it&rsquo;s easy to do fancy martial arts move but to tell the truth is much more harder. To me it mean to don&rsquo;t make my life more shinier than it really is just to brag, be humble and not being the man who think he knows everything. Always be happy to be wrong and recognize it. I know how hard it is to step back from things that I have previously said. It&rsquo;s considerate as a sign of psychological disorder to change your mind, &ldquo;unstable&rdquo;, &ldquo;conflictual&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s better being wrong and realizing it than being wrong and keeping your position just to maintain congruency with my past words or acts. Take my articles, I could go back and argue with a lot of them. So it makes me incongruent with my past unless I don&rsquo;t consider it as <em>my past</em> but simply <em>past</em>. An older version of me which is outdated. Would I be mad for a program bugs that were fix long ago ? No. But I would be if they were unfix bugs</p>

<p>Live my acts, that&rsquo;s taking full responsibility for previous acts. Fight for my words, but happily admit being wrong with no ego. Past will always be here. I harm people sometimes, I ain&rsquo;t proud of stuff. But be brutal and confront myself. Live your past, carry it, there&rsquo;s no escaping. Ultimately it&rsquo;s my choice to make it more heavier than it is or not&hellip;</p>

<h1>Final words</h1>

<p>I know this value has to be the first when I read the 7 habits of highly effective people. The first word that did come to mind was authenticity. Even though I knew it was it, it still took me 3 months to write it and have the courage to post. I guess I&rsquo;ve consciously delayed the writing of this value for so long for a reason. I am afraid of the consequences that this value will have to my life when I completely adopt it. I know i&rsquo;m still not totally living by honesty. The power of engagement will help me since I made a public announcement about it. When I visualize what qualities I want people to remember me for&hellip; I hope they will see me as an honest dude who asked the right question for their growth.</p>

<p>Nowadays I&rsquo;ll try my best to live this value <strong><em>Be Brutally Honest</em></strong>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/2015-reflection.jpg"></p>

<p>2015 is almost over and I had some great epiphany during this year. I like to take some time to reflect every 3-6 month with myself, <strong>MY LIFE</strong> (and not other people vision on life). Check what have done lately, I&rsquo;m I doing the things that I must do instead of what I should do? <a href="https://vimeo.com/120355373">The Importance of Doing What You Love by Elle Luna</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So I opened up my calendar to see what were my appointments</p>

<ul>
<li>The product I&rsquo;m developing at <a href="http://www.plezi.co/">plezi</a> got release, after one year of work. I can&rsquo;t help but feeling proud about it</li>
<li>I asked for a raise. Sometimes you just have to have the gut to ask</li>
<li>I said yes to a spontaneous road trip, which end up leading to Etretat and sleeping on a hill. Everyone has things to do, but I feel like life will only get more busier</li>
<li>I accomplish my first year of shiatsu and expanded my perception on eastern medicine.</li>
<li>I tried to fast during 7 days. <a href="http://philippetring.fr/blog/2015/09/12/experience-do-not-eat-for-a-week/">Experience: Do Not Eat For A Week</a></li>
<li>I walked Camino de Santiago, also got there by hitchhiking from Paris</li>
<li>I deepen my relationship with my friends and I&rsquo;m happy to call 3 person on this universe that way. They make me a little more courageous and compassionate. Thank you</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s also the year have been reading the most. It&rsquo;s funny how my reading have been following my grow during the year. All of this did not happen in a single day, and it&rsquo;s awesome seeing who I was a year before and who I am today.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the light side, and it&rsquo;s fairly easy to brag about it. But on the dark side I can&rsquo;t count how many things didn&rsquo;t work this year. But the question I should ask myself is do I like my life? If not remove what makes me unhappy. Because it only takes one success to make all those experiences worth</p>

<p>That was a lot of I. Your turn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reflect on your last year and celebrate achievements then share them with whoever you want</li>
<li>Ask yourself what makes you unhappy and remove it this year</li>
</ul>


<p>Ps: I just wrote a <a href="http://philippetring.fr/now">now</a> page which list what i&rsquo;m up to. Where is my focus, <a href="http://philippetring.fr/now">check it out</a>.</p>

<p>This article is a part of my 30 days challenge &ldquo;One Problem A Day&rdquo;. Where I have to solve a problem I have through my day. Today: <strong> How to face writing block? </strong></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I missed yesterday OPAB. Usually when I miss something. I stop, instead of being persistant. That&rsquo;s funny because the day before I was super in the flow for writing. I don&rsquo;t know how it feel from the exterior but creating everyday is crazily hard. You have to always push yourself and deny every good excuse that come your way (being tired, don&rsquo;t having the time).</p>

<p>And one of my block was that I was only doing all my challenges for myself. So if I don&rsquo;t write who cares really? Nobody knew. But now with the blog every one might.</p>

<p>So how can I prevent failling? I can&rsquo;t it will eventually happen. But I can at least minimize the amount of energy it takes me to start writing.</p>

<p>It mean 2 things for now. Always having a pen and some paper (I want to buy a &ldquo;moleskine&rdquo; really badly haha). And having my computer ready to write every time.</p>

<p>This article is a part of my 30 days challenge &ldquo;One Problem A Day&rdquo;. Where I have to solve a problem I have through my day. Today: <strong> Values one: Why do I breath? </strong></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to start this article. I am so excited to start writing about it. I was literally in the transport with no paper left and tons of ideas were flowing through me. Think i&rsquo;m also half wasted which hasn&rsquo;t happen for years. Just to warn you when i&rsquo;m drunk I tend to tell everybody I love that I do love them (my little sister and mother just had me hugging them for quite a while&hellip; With all my after sport session odor of course).</p>

<p>Before start I need to share 2 things&hellip; No 3 things. I had training (that&rsquo;s one), got myself beat a few times as usual much respect to all my sparing partners and it was incredible. Two we had a few drink but more important a lot of laugh (I couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling during my one hour of commute back home). Three.. I forgot 3 might come back might not.</p>

<p>That being said after all my previous speech on happiness I think I have a pretty good answer to what&rsquo;s happiness to me. <strong>It&rsquo;s building long lasting relationship with people I do care about</strong>. Let them teach me a lot of thing and do my best to have a positive impact on them. It&rsquo;s making them smile and share no&hellip; SHARE moment with them. Lately i&rsquo;m pretty introverted. I tend to focus on myself, &ldquo;be a better version of me&rdquo;. But for who? For me. And that&rsquo;s obviously not working. My mood and attitude got lower. I&rsquo;m the best me only when i&rsquo;m with those people who move me. Those people I hate but also love.</p>

<p>Some of them are ALWAYS ******** late, some are messy as crazy. But I still love being with them. And so happy to see them when the last time have seen them was only 2 weeks ago. Hope they will recognize themselves !</p>

<p>I do remember number three !! Happiness, I was so happy commuting back home, I took a bicycle at the last km. And I haven&rsquo;t feel that great biking since&hellip; Going on my Paris to London on a bike trip. I was aware of the wind, my legs and foot pushing the bike, I was here not going from point A to B just here, living the moment. I am so use to forget about my journey, only focussing on my destination that I&rsquo;m always skipping the now. Which is as important as the moment I arrive at the point B.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s my first value? What is the first thing I want to stand for in my life? <strong>Grow as an independent being and help people I care about grow</strong>. My memory will disappear soon enough after my last breath, my money won&rsquo;t serve me anymore, my stuff won&rsquo;t last forever but if I did exist for those few people I&rsquo;ll be done here. I might not change the world but I do hope I&rsquo;ll change their world.</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>Talking about stuff, one of the fine lady at the dojo make me realize how much have changed since she knows me (2 years ago). I was a stuff oriented guy, always with a new dress. Now I only have 2 pants and 3 t-shirts, is it good? Probably not for everybody but for me at this moment it is. And that&rsquo;s what matter, living on my belief. Picture is me 2 years ago</p>

<p>This article is a part of my 30 days challenge &ldquo;One Problem A Day&rdquo;. Where I have to solve a problem I have through my day. Today: <strong> On happiness? part 2 </strong></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Had no problem today so i&rsquo;ll just continue on my questioning on happiness. Last time I said happiness is already in me. Maybe all I need to do is let it express itself? My mum gave me a mini handy book about buddhism few weeks ago. After my research it seems that we need to drop everything or at least this is the goal as a buddhist. (I might miss interpret i&rsquo;m far from an theologist on buddhism).</p>

<p>But looking to have no attachment material and/or emotional we can&rsquo;t loose right? We can&rsquo;t be sad because we already have nothing? But a life with no attachment is it really a life?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s one of the thing that do scare me. Since I live on nothing today (I&rsquo;m talking about money / cost of life) it&rsquo;s easy to go on adventure with nothing. But will I have the courage to drop my comfy flat once I get use to it? I read a experiment in &ldquo;Stumbling on Happiness&rdquo;. People were offered 60k first year then 50k then 40k OR 30k then 40k then 50k. People always choose the second option regardless of the obvious gain in money to take the first choice.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s probably also related to the fact that we want to see progress in our lives and can&rsquo;t stand to be demolish in a way or another.</p>

<p>But at the same time if I decide to attache myself to nothing and nobody I&rsquo;ll get jealous about other people possession, I want the last iPhone too ! So I need to neglect other people but it&rsquo;s so human to compare me / my possession with other people. Think people who reach that state, being egoless non toxic and self confident must have something else. A belief that what they do is right. and since i&rsquo;m not sure my way is the right way i&rsquo;m stuck.</p>

<p>What I need to work on to let my happiness blossom is my believe, not in god but what do I believe my values are. So instead of comparing myself with other I&rsquo;ll be able to compare myself with my values. I have few ideas for my values. But had never took the time to write about it properly.</p>

<p>I like the way this challenge make me wonder about life. Really, don&rsquo;t know if what I say is accurate or even make sense but&hellip; Yeah whatever.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty funny given all the things I can do in life that we achieve being in a state of bored no? Is being bored something that animals feel or only humans? Ok let&rsquo;s come up with 10 things I can do.</p>

<ol>
<li>Write anything on anything. You never know what you might come up with</li>
<li>Send a message to somebody you want to meet. Or better call an old acquaintance</li>
<li>Take some time to breathe</li>
<li>Make a to do of what I need to do before leaving</li>
<li>Run / exercice</li>
<li>Read</li>
<li>Clean my room / organize my stuff. I think the act of organizing physically something have the same effect on your mind somehow !</li>
<li>Wow it start to be hard after 7&hellip; Cook? (I usually never cook)</li>
<li>OH I HAVE A GOOD ONE ! Ask myself if i&rsquo;m heading to the right direction for my life.</li>
<li>Do something, anything but do something.</li>

<p>How am I suppose to find a solution to nothing. My problem of the day is that I had no problem. (huhu)</p>

<p>Think that&rsquo;s a good reminder that people who looks for trouble can always find some. But honestly today have been great. Had a yoga session at Lululemon (This company is great) and it was free ! Then I walked back home exploring streets of Paris I&rsquo;ve never seen before. Family launch, few videos, few mails and some paper I had to fill. Then at night I run almost an hour to see an old friend of mine back from London. Played some board game like a child and met a lot of interesting people.</p>

<p>Basically i&rsquo;ve learn a lot today ! Will I remember that day as a great day? Maybe if I read this article one day who knows</p>

<p>This article is a part of my 30 days challenge &ldquo;One Problem A Day&rdquo;. Where I have to solve a problem I have through my day. Today: <strong> How to make the most out of school? </strong></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Guess I&rsquo;ve done nothing at school today, I procrastinate taking everything in my reach to don&rsquo;t work. So what can I do to make the most of this time I have to spend here?</p>

<p>Start a business on the side. To create wealth or value as passive income, visibility, sharpens skill that will matter lately. But knowing that everything can be learn. Choosing the right field to invest my time on is blocking me: paradox of choice, having too much abundance make me stuck. Pick something whatever and do something.</p>

<p>Does everything I learn need to be useful thought? I know not but I can&rsquo;t stop blaming myself not being &ldquo;productive&rdquo;. Yesterday I spoke about happiness and how the Bhutan check for growth in happiness. <strong>With mathematics started the era of numbers when older people use to have different metrics</strong>. Without number, productivity, marks and other metrics life must have been so different. We want proof that it works before starting anything nowadays (This apply so much to me, HOLY MOLLY !)</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m going off topic here, back to school. (I actually smiled when writing this haha). Skills and career out. I think school is before everything else the best time to connect to people, thing that I don&rsquo;t do enough. Proof, I&rsquo;m here typing on a keyboard talking to nobody but myself while I could be exchanging with people made of blood and heart next to me.</p>

<p>Maybe I focus way too much on myself. Maybe I should change the challenge from &ldquo;fix one problem I have during my day&rdquo; to &ldquo;help someone fix his problem&rdquo;? But who am I to help someone. People didn&rsquo;t ask for anything. But I do ask myself for help right here.</p>

<p>Another thing is that I focus too much on the future me. I should relax&hellip; No I&rsquo;ll relax. There is no rush for me to start traveling I want everything and right now. Why the rush? Put your belt and enjoy your journey through school. I know lot of people miss that time after it&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p>Lastly to make the most out of school I shouldn&rsquo;t focus on the reward (the degree). But on what I&rsquo;m learning. And what do I learn here? The degree do not mean I made it, right? Take the number to change, how many of us will have no suitable jobs? What I learn at school is simply to learn for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Philippe, student of life hopefully I&rsquo;ll never drop out.</p>

<p>This article is a part of my 30 days challenge &ldquo;One Problem A Day&rdquo;. Where I have to solve a problem I have through my day. Today: <strong> How to be happy? </strong></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Ok, how should I start that hard question it might seem too optimist to answer this question for everyone so I&rsquo;ll try to solve it for me. What&rsquo;s happiness? Is it me watching a youtube video, eating awesome food, laughing hard with my friend, having sex, being rich? All that is pleasure for sure and does bring happiness for a short instant but in the long term wont bring sustainable source of happiness. What&rsquo;s the common denominator for all of these things? They come from outer world instead of my inner self. Does eating more or that will make me forever happy? Having multiple partner for intercourse, a higher salary, all those numbers. I heard Bhutan is calculating happiness grow in their country. I wonder how they do that.</p>

<p>In the old time when math doesn&rsquo;t exists life must be so much different. We are now numbers everywhere. Of like, share, salary&hellip; So if I follow the hypothesis that happiness come from inside and not outside. How can it be ?</p>

<h1>How can I speak about happiness without speaking about sadness? One doesn&rsquo;t exists without the other.</h1>

<p>If happiness cannot exists without sadness then two solutions come to my mind.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I can only be happy if someone else is sad ?</p></li>
<li><p>I can only be happy for a determined amount of time until sadness come back to me.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I don&rsquo;t like the first option because I hope everybody can be happy (shameless way to put it out of the way haha).</p>

<p>If happiness and sadness are both natural state. It make me realize that being happy is already a possibility in me. If that&rsquo;s the case how can I be more happy than sad and more importantly recover from sadness to be back to a happy state? Well I have no clue but right now I want to go to the dojo and practice martial art.</p>

<p>This article is a part of my 30 days challenge &ldquo;One Problem A Day&rdquo;. Where I have to solve a problem I have through my day. Today: <strong> How much money do I need to live? </strong></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;m starting to realize that in a few months I won&rsquo;t hang out in Gobelins anymore (My school). Will I miss it? Probably not. I&rsquo;m bored and can&rsquo;t wait for what&rsquo;s next. But what&rsquo;s next? I have no clue. I&rsquo;m searching for path, possibilities. The most appealing one is to travel around the world like a hobo. But it&rsquo;s also the scariest one. So I&rsquo;m looking for a job and I start asking myself what&rsquo;s a good job? I see plenty of my developer friend who after a few months in a well paying job stop it to pursue an uncertain path to grow a business and i&rsquo;m very impress by them. So money is not the problem, people don&rsquo;t want to be rich we want the possibilities that offer money.</p>

<p>At 2k money I can live more than enough. So here&rsquo;s my number, how can I make it for the least amount of time so I can enjoy life the rest. Here&rsquo;s one of adult life goal, having 2k of income each month for the less amount of work (Work: Time I dislike the use of).</p>

<p>This lead naturally to tomorrow problem. How do I get happy?</p>

<p>This article is a part of my 30 days challenge &ldquo;One Problem A Day&rdquo;. Where I have to solve a problem I have through my day. Today: How to respond to violence?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>People in my class bought some Nerf (Plastic gun) to battle in the classroom. Then for fun one of them aimed his gun toward me&hellip;</p>

<p>Edward, a Bagua (Form of Tai Chi) practicer once told me there&rsquo;s 3 way to react from an aggression:</p>

<ol>
<li>Freeze. It can be because you are afraid but also simply because you hope the predator won&rsquo;t see you like a butterfly or ostrich</li>
<li>Flight. Run, as fast as you can avoid, dodge the threat !</li>
<li>Fight. Put your arms up and be brave</li>
</ol>


<p>Guess what I did in front of this Nerf pointing at me? Did I fight, flight or freeze? I freeze, put my hands up to hide my face and did nothing else hoping he&rsquo;ll not shoot. Ok he was my friend and I knew nothing so bad would happen.</p>

<p>Another time I was biking in Paris when a car hit me at slow speed but I catch myself and keep rolling. The man get out of his car and start yelling at me. In my head confident in my few years of martial art training I thought he deserved a lesson but I kept rolling and I&rsquo;m very happy I did.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the point of all my practice in the dojo? Being ashamed of myself because I can&rsquo;t respond to violence? I think it&rsquo;s worth it for me to freeze and run even if I have a pretty good chance to win a fight. First harming someone doesn&rsquo;t feel good, I can live with a bit of shame I&rsquo;d rather not break anything. I also preserved the good relationship I have with my friend. I think the only time I&rsquo;ll need my martial art skill is to fight for someone else or my life. It&rsquo;s the last choice and there&rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed if you run or lower your head.</p>

<p>This article is a part of my 30 days challenge &ldquo;One Problem A Day&rdquo;. Where I have to solve a problem I have through my day. Today: How to remember people?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Today I had to lend Getting Things Done the book to a classmate boyfriend. But I forgot the name and had to say &ldquo;Hey give that to your honey&rdquo;. Well I&rsquo;m almost 23 and have already a hard time remembering people name, im getting old&hellip; That&rsquo;s why today I created a system ! It&rsquo;s called&hellip; Badaboum&hellip; Drum sound&hellip; Well, I don&rsquo;t know the name of it yet. Any suggestion?</p>

<h1>The system</h1>

<p>Everytime i&rsquo;ll meet a new person can be anyone, the guy from the supermarket to the neighbour. i&rsquo;m going to put it on my evernote note called &ldquo;People Reminder&rdquo;. Just the name and few details that might or might not be relevant. Simple, clean, not sophisticate&hellip; Like me ! (except the clean part)</p>

<p>I do hope that this will pay in the long run. And even if it doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s worth the try. Obviously most of the people on this list. I&rsquo;ll never meet again but it will be so powerfull when socializing and the weirdo I am need to compensate somewhere.</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>Picture is a guy this summer who was running instead of walking on camino de santiago. I run with him during a day when it was raining like never before. It was awesome but I ended in a hospital the next day ! I can&rsquo;t match a name with his face&hellip;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Heck I didn&rsquo;t feel like starting this month challenge. I had the most unproductive week end ever, watched my computer all week and slept. Think I had this unproductive 2 days because I didn&rsquo;t wanted to face my life problem ! It was so much easier to lay on my bed all day instead of deciding what I want to do with my life. Take this job opportunity with lot of skills I can learn or discover the world. Just the thought of it already give me a headache.</p>

<p>So what can I do when I feel like shit? The answer came while watching One Piece with my little sister. A giant named Saul have an awkward laugh &ldquo;Deshishishi&rdquo; and he teach a little girl to smile even when life is apparently bad. So here I was in front of my mirror with my one minute timer set, laughing at myself, trying to replicate him. Which ended being hilarious !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/fasting.jpg"></p>

<p>Recently I tried not to eat for a week. In my attempt the rules were simple. I could only drink water, tea, and sparkling water.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Why did i try to fast for a week?</h1>

<p>We were sitting with one of my friend planning our 30 days challenges of the year when he told me about water fasting. He told me about the benefit for the body allowing it to recover and giving it enough time to get rid or the toxins. He shook some of my belief about food and the way we consider our food. I also had heard about Ghandi fasting for what he believed and my mom had a lot of no food days back in her days. All I needed was someone to push me trying it for myself.</p>

<h1>How it goes?</h1>

<p><strong>First day (Thursday)</strong> was interesting at around 10 o’clock i was super hungry. I think my mind knew he was going to starve so I was hungrier than usual. After a power nap instead of usual meal I was fine. Bed time and going to sleep made me realize not eating for a day was actually much more easier than I thought.</p>

<p><strong>Second day (Friday)</strong> I had an epiphany… Not having to think about what I’m going to eat is such a freedom. You don’t start wondering what your meal is going to be ! It’s impressive how much my mind is thinking about food on a regular day.</p>

<p><strong>Third day (Saturday)</strong> was easy despite not being as busy as I am at work. I even get to go to my martial art class at Parc de la Villette with no impact on me. (Maybe my teacher was going easy on me because he knew i was fasting). At night I realized food was also a social connector. Most of the time I hang out in restaurants, bars, or whatever. It’s just a good reason to meet with my friends.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth (Sunday)</strong> day was terrible i’ve done nothing but laying on my bed all day and skipped classical dance class (lot of classy here !). It was also the day that I gave up on the fast, at night I couldn’t sleep and when I walked to my restroom my balance was so messed up that I felt on to the ground. I texted my friend who inspired me to do the fast and told me it was all right (I felt guilty leaving him alone). But before eating that pineapple in the fridge I made a quick video to remember how I felt. (It wasn’t supposed to go public so don’t be shy and enjoy seeing me half naked)</p>

<h1>Now come the time to reflect.</h1>

<p>I really get a chance to think back on food. Might sound obvious but I’m grateful to have food in my plate whenever I want. This line doesn’t make justice to the way this experience made me have a new look at food. Think it’s kind of like love, faith, being angry those are things someone need to experiment in order to know it.</p>

<p>Food is everywhere and I did spend a lot of time thinking about it on <strong>3 main fields</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Time</strong>,
I waste so much time thinking about food. What I’m I going to eat today? Question start at 11am. Then the same at night. All this time spending making decision is time and energy not available to think about what really matter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health</strong>,
Is this good for my health? I feel guilty eating too much. Eating junk too much. As my friend said:</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>We are what we eat.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Money</strong>,
Well this one don’t bother me. I don’t care paying a lot to eat good stuff. It’s not about the money itself but the way industry appeal me to buy always more food. The more you buy the less you spend for the amount I have. Then I end up eating more food of usually bad food. It’s just not working in the right direction. Now I know I don’t need to eat that much to live.</li>
</ul>


<p>So now that I know all that what I’m I going to do?</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop eating when i’m bored and do 5 minutes relaxation instead (Replace with something you find pleasure in)</li>
<li>During eat time. Stop when I feel 80% full (Pareto law).</li>
<li>Deny free food if I’m not hungry.</li>
<li>Stop taking the food that has the most quantity and think in terms of quality.</li>
<li>Avoid plain sugar</li>
</ul>


<p>Food on a less conscious state is also a lot of other things. An entertainment, an object of pleasure, I got food when I’m bored, when I’m depressed, when I socialize, when I spend money (a lot of money), when I have sex (sometimes), as a gift, as an addiction, as a huge part of economy, as a diet, as a reward…
During the fast I had progressively all those field getting back at me. At first I wanted to eat food to distract me, then because my friend were going to eat, then at the end because I was hungry. Back to the basic, the fundamental. Food is my body essence.</p>

<p>Thanks to Ali for his help writing this and inspiring me to make this wonderful experience.</p>

<p>La famille dans laquelle on grandit est responsable d&#8217;une grande partie de notre futur nous. Quand je regarde les habitudes de notre société occidentale et celle des traditions amenées par la culture orientale transmis par mes origines. Je comprends mieux le mal que j&#8217;ai à m&#8217;acclimater parfois.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Je prends comme exemple les repas, car c&#8217;est le moment qui réunit une famille, le rite. La chose que j’aime le plus est dans le partage de la nourriture à la maison. 2/3 des repas consiste en un buffet ou tout le monde se sert à son gré. Contrairement aux repas occidentaux où chacun à son plat et se l&#8217;approprie.</p>

<p>D&#8217;un autre côté, mes parents ayant connu la famine célèbrent tout par la nourriture. Mon grand frère qui revient samedi aura probablement le plat qu&#8217;il souhaite. À nos anniversaires nous avons le choix de la nourriture plutôt qu&#8217;un choix de cadeau.</p>

<p>La seconde chose qui m&#8217;interpelle est la conversation. La plupart de nos repas sont pleins de blanc. De silence, les enfants apprennent à écouter avant de parler. Merci Confucius. Ce qui n&#8217;est pas mal, mais demande une réadaptation par la suite.</p>

<p>Enfin sur les couverts. Nous utilisons des baguettes au lieu de couteau et fourchette. C&#8217;est une jolie métaphore, celle de la non-violence. Lorsque l&#8217;on pique et coupe, d&#8217;autres transportent la nourriture avec délicatesse et respect exerçant uniquement la force nécessaire afin de maintenir la denrée le temps du transport.</p>

<p>Finalement, la part des choses est à faire une fois adulte. Que garder et quoi enlever? La perfection étant lorsqu&#8217;il n&#8217;y&#8217;a plus rien à enlever. La vie c&#8217;est peut-être ça au final. Au départ, nous sommes tous vides puis nous nous remplissons soit d&#8217;eau pure, claire, bonne ou d&#8217;eau malsaine, impure. Parfois, nous arrêtons de nous remplir ou renversons de l&#8217;eau. Enfin, notre eau peut toujours être éclaircie ou polluée. Nous sommes les seuls à pouvoir décider de la contenance de notre conteneur.</p>

<p>Qu&#8217;est ce que je vais faire aujourd&#8217;hui pour rendre mon eau plus claire et me remplir aujourd&#8217;hui ?</p>

<p>Ma petite soeur rentre aujourd&#8217;hui d&#8217;un voyage scolaire de 5 jours en Angleterre. J&#8217;ai très hate qu&#8217;elle me raconte ses aventures. Et me demande a quelle point sont anglais s&#8217;est amélioré. Pourquoi s&#8217;immerger dans une culture?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>J&#8217;ai fait le voyageur touriste en Inde en visitant de multiples monuments. Du cyclo tourisme en Angleterre. En habitant et aidant les locaux Au Bangladesh. Cet été j&#8217;esseyerais en marchant. S&#8217;immerger dans une culture est pour moi devenu très important. Car je pense que c&#8217;est le seul moyen de &ldquo;sentir&rdquo; le pays. Le premier pas est de parler la langue puis de repérer les traditions enfin d&#8217;y prendre part. Comme faire le ramadan au Bangladesh. Aucun n&#8217;ai néanmoins la meilleur façon de voyager, chacun ont leurs avantages</p>

<blockquote><p>Si j&#8217;agis comme un touriste les gens me prendront comme un touriste.</p></blockquote>

<p>Comment agissez vous en voyage?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/abandons-and-echecs.jpg"></p>

<p>Il est 5h33 du matin et je commence mon article de la journée d&#8217;hier. Les deadlines de beaucoup de mes projets se rapprochent, je viens de passer une partie de la nuit à dormir et l&#8217;autre à compléter <a href="http://gobelins-link.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Link</a>&hellip; L&#8217;application de correspondance pour lier les enfants du monde.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Il y&#8217;a une croyance dans les projets, celle que l&#8217;échec est bien, est &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, est un rite de passage vers la réussite. J&#8217;aime être optimiste (et j&#8217;utilise un peu trop ce mot !). Penser que j&#8217;ai suffisamment de volonté pour vaincre ma procrastination et arriver au bout de mes objectifs. Pourtant quand je regarde en arrière dans cette année scolaire qui s&#8217;est écoulée je compte un bon nombre d&#8217;abandons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Je n&#8217;ai pas atteint l&#8217;Écosse en vélo.</li>
<li>Le projet <a href="http://bonjourtoi.me/" target="_blank">Bonjour Toi</a> où je devais interviewer et dire bonjour à des passants dans le métro parisien a été orphelins au bout de 5 jours.</li>
<li>Le projet bonjour Gobelins où je devais interviewer le personnel de Gobelins et faire une exposition d&#8217;eux n&#8217;a pas vu le jour.</li>
<li>Le programme de danse libre, d&#8217;expression corporelle n&#8217;a pas dépassé le stade administratif.</li>
<li>Je n&#8217;ai pas lancé d&#8217;application sur l&#8217;App Store.</li>
<li>Je n&#8217;ai pas contribué pendant 30 jours à des projets open source.</li>
</ul>


<p>Le problème avec le fait de penser que l&#8217;échec est un des stades obligatoires pour la réussite. Je me concentre sur échouer. Je devrais plutôt me concentrer sur la réussite. Non pas sur mon plan de secours en cas d&#8217;échec, mais comment faire en sorte qu&#8217;il soit succès.</p>

<blockquote><p>Je vise l’échec au lieu de la réussite.</p></blockquote>

<p>Puis qu&#8217;est-ce que l&#8217;échec ? J&#8217;ai un but, j&#8217;ai plusieurs phases pour y arriver puis ça n&#8217;arrive pas pour des raisons parfois extérieur, parfois intérieur. L&#8217;échec c&#8217;est surtout quand on se dit que l&#8217;on a échoué et que l&#8217;échec nous brise. Tous ces échecs me mettent K.O et je m&#8217;en plains ou alors&hellip; J&#8217;avance en acceptant ces échecs. Philoptimiste du grec ancien qui aime l&#8217;optimisme, ça ferait un bon nom de blog, non?</p>

<p>J&#8217;ai souvent cette impression avec ce que je lis que l&#8217;auteur en rajoute peut-être pour que je ne me sente pas dupé en achetant un bouquin de 50 pages. On ne juge pas un livre à sa couverture, mais est-ce vrai pour son nombre de pages? Les dessins et illustrations qui le composent? Mes parents me disaient souvent que lire des mangas ne compte pas. Ils ne seraient pas de &ldquo;vrais bouquins&rdquo;. Pourtant dans les mangas comme un ami me l&#8217;a fait justement remarquer, contient tous les genres. Pour enfants, jeune fille, jeune garçon, adolescents, pour adultes. Et lorsque quelqu&#8217;un prend la peine d&#8217;écrire un livre court, ils ont une préface de 50 pages suivie d&#8217;un commentaire de 100 pages.</p>

<p>Il y&#8217;a un minimalisme dans l&#8217;écriture, aller à l&#8217;essentiel. Si je retravaillais tous mes articles, j&#8217;enlèverais probablement la moitié, voire les &frac34;.</p>

<p>De l&#8217;autre côté ajouté, des détails permettent au lecteur de s&#8217;immerger. Raisons pour les histoires d&#8217;être longue. Il y&#8217;a une fierté dans le fait de lire un gros bouquin. En écrivant je devrais me demander, est-ce que cette ligne ajoute de la valeur à mon article? Le problème c&#8217;est que je ne sais même pas où va cet article&hellip; Haha. J&#8217;aime bien faire semblant de faire des trucs grands. J&#8217;ai voyagé de x à y, je suis resté de x à y heure à travaillé. Mais en vrai, j&#8217;ai passé une bonne partie du temps à regarder en l&#8217;air.</p>

<p>Cet article n’est pas génial ! Hum&hellip; Il est loin d&#8217;être parfait. Je le laisserais bien de côté, mais c&#8217;est déjà mon 3e essai ce soir. La perfection c&#8217;est lorsqu&#8217;il n&#8217;y&#8217;a rien à enlever. Mais je ne cherche pas à accomplir la perfection et au contraire à me prendre quelques coups pour m&#8217;endurcir, endurcir ma plume. Peut être qu&#8217;écrire tous les jours est une façon pour moi d&#8217;avoir l&#8217;impression de faire un truc. La nuit porte conseil. Demain je parlerais d&#8217;échecs !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/le-flow.jpg"></p>

<p>L&#8217;un de mes plus beaux souvenirs de mon voyage en Angleterre, c&#8217;est lorsque je remontais une pente, qui me paraissait infinie. Il pleuvait des cordes et des cordes ce jour-là. Il faut m&#8217;imaginer avec des gants de vaisselle jaune en guise de gant imperméable, deux sacs plastiques pour couvrir mes tongs et un survêtement acheté 20 euros à Décathlon. Juste à côté de moi roulaient des voitures avec leurs essuie-glaces sur la cadence maximum. À ce moment-là, je me souviens juste avoir crié de toute mes cordes vocales</p>

<blockquote><p>AAAAAH JE PEUX LE FAIRE</p></blockquote>

<p>J&#8217;avais certainement l&#8217;air fou. Mais je m&#8217;en moquais. La seule chose qui comptait vraiment était l&#8217;instant présent.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>J&#8217;adore cette sensation, j&#8217;imagine que la plupart d&#8217;entre nous l&#8217;ont déjà vécu. Que ce soit lors d&#8217;un effort intense ou pendant un acte de créativité comme l&#8217;écriture, la programmation, le dessin, voir même la vaisselle. Certains appellent cela la zone, le flow, être présent. C&#8217;est un moment intemporel, comme si nous n&#8217;existions plus et existions totalement à la fois. Nous agissons et sommes mentalement concentrés uniquement par la tâche qui nous incombe ici et maintenant.</p>

<p>Quelques personnes dans mon entourage questionnent les raisons de mes trips solitaires à vélo ou à pieds. Après l&#8217;effort physique, notre corps plein de courbatures qui ne se préoccupent plus de rien mis à part contempler les étoiles sur son hamac. Mon esprit a alors tout le temps d&#8217;être ici. Voyager doucement, en regardant autour de soi. Développer son physique autant que sa tête, ça me parait cohérent.</p>

<blockquote><p>Notre corps le conteneur et notre esprit le contenu.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ça ne me viendrait jamais à l&#8217;idée de mettre du thé dans un verre troué. Je soupçonne aussi le but de la méditation d&#8217;être ceci, pouvoir rentrer à sa guise dans cet état où la seule chose qui compte est ici et maintenant. Car la prochaine minute n&#8217;existera peut-être pas.</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>Photo du jour est prise très tôt le matin au bord de Brighton. Juste après une douche glaciale dans la mer où j&#8217;ai crié au contact de l&#8217;eau comme un bébé à la naissance.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/vivre-pieds-nus.jpg"></p>

<p>Cela fait plusieurs mois que je me balade en tong, plus précisément avec des sandales à la semelle très fine. Si fine que je sens le moindre caillou sous mes pieds lorsque je marche, comme si j&#8217;étais pieds nus. Vivre pieds nus est un mode de vie.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Au début, cela parait contre nature de ne pas se protéger avec une semelle pour amortir les chocs de mes pas. Puis au fur et à mesure, mon corps s’est habitué. Je suis maintenant attentif à ma façon de me mouvoir au quotidien. Cela a pour conséquence de plus prendre soin de mes foulées et mon corps au quotidien. J&#8217;ai aussi la plante des pieds plus durs, j&#8217;avais déjà l&#8217;habitude au dojo, pendant la danse de me balader pieds nus, mais l&#8217;être au quotidien c&#8217;est encore mieux.</p>

<p>Le mois suivant, je vais commencer à courir avec ces mêmes sandales. Inspiré par le livre born to run. Qui relate l&#8217;histoire du peuple tarahumara vivant au Mexique et ayant la particularité de courir de très longue distance homme comme femme de tout âge avec des sandales. Néanmoins, je sais pour avoir déjà essayé que je vais courir moins vite avec ces sandales, quel intérêt alors?</p>

<p>Dans un monde où tout va plus vite, les échanges, le nombre de kilomètres que l&#8217;on peut parcourir, demandant d&#8217;être plus productif chaque jour. Prendre le temps de courir en prenant soin de son corps de façon fluide et silencieuse comme un chat et non pas en faisant des pas d&#8217;éléphant. Être conscient de son corps, de ses mouvements ne pas chercher la performance, mais prendre le temps d&#8217;apprécier chaque foulée. C&#8217;est un peu la différence entre faire le tour du monde à pieds et faire le tour du monde en avion. Les deux ont fait le tour du monde, mais le voyage est totalement différent.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/comment-avoir-plus-de-sous.jpg"></p>

<p>Il y’a 2 façons d’avoir plus d’économie. Gagner plus et dépenser moins. Cet article est une suite à mon post précédent. Comment je compte vivre dans notre système capitaliste.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Gagner plus</h1>

<p>Comment générer plus de revenus? Oser demander une augmentation méritée.Travailler plus à côté. Mais aussi obtenir des compétences ou tirer parti de ses compétences actuelles pour ensuite revendre ce savoir. Si vous êtes étudiants: vendez vos dessins, photos, des cours d’algèbre, faites du baby-sitting. Bref travailler !</p>

<p>Le problème une fois que l’on gagne des sous ou plus de sous c’est que j’ai commencé par tout simplement dépenser plus. Pourtant j’arrivais autrefois à vivre sans ce supplément. Je me suis donc demandé comment il se fait que je n’arrive pas à économiser ce surplus. J’ai calculé mon cout de vie à Paris, 1200 euros par mois. (700 euros logement + 30 internet + 2 téléphone + 30 transports + 20 mutuelle + 300 nourritures + 50 arts martiaux + 100 loisirs/whatever). En vérité, je suis plutôt à 1000 euros par mois, mais j’ai gonflé les prix.</p>

<p>Imaginait maintenant un salaire à 2000 euros net. Pouvoir économiser 800 euros par mois à l’avenir c’est la sécurité.D’avoir toujours de la marge. J’espère donc lorsque j’aurais encore plus de revenus que je ne tomberais pas dans le piège de dépenser plus.</p>

<h1>Dépenser moins</h1>

<p>Mes règles pour dépenser moins:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>La totalité de ceux que je possède doit rentrer dans mon sac à dos 36L. Cela me permet de ne pas m’encombrer de choses inutiles. D’être plus libre et flexible dans mes déplacements. Vivre avec un sac à dos comme possession c’est mon rêve.</p></li>
<li><p>Avant de faire un achat à long terme, il doit tenir 1 mois dans ma liste de souhaits. Cela me permet de bien réfléchir mes décisions, et prendre du recul sur l’utilité de l’achat, éviter les achats impulsifs. (La nourriture et les livres ne comptent pas).</p></li>
<li><p>Acheter la meilleure qualité ou le moins chère. Si j’ai besoin d’acheter quelque chose, je me procure constamment la meilleure qualité du produit si je souhaite le garder longtemps. Si c’est un besoin présent (un parapluie par exemple). J’achèterais le moins cher et m’en débarrasserais ensuite. Le moyen de gamme est pour moi le pire des deux mondes.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Questions que je me pose avant d’acheter de la nourriture</h1>

<ul>
<li>Privilégier les choses bonnes pour la santé, un maximum possible. Peu importe le prix.</li>
<li>Me demander si dans 1 an je me souviendrais de ce met.</li>
<li>Ne JAMAIS rechigner à payer pour quelqu’un !</li>
</ul>

<p>J&#8217;ai eu beau durant de très longues années tenter de me convaincre que je me moque de l&#8217;argent. Arrive un moment ou la réalité nous rattrape. L&#8217;argent va occuper une place dans ma vie.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Aujourd&#8217;hui, un de mes proches faisait un état des lieux de ses finances après 2 ans d&#8217;emploi à mi-temps. C&#8217;est amusant comme la notion d&#8217;argent n&#8217;est pas abordée à l&#8217;école. L&#8217;endroit censé nous préparer à la vie. Nous vivons pourtant dans un système capitaliste (je n&#8217;ai rien contre ce système au passage, malgré ses défauts, il fait tourner le monde). L&#8217;argent tient un rôle central dans notre organisation. Je suis né dans ce système, et compte m&#8217;y adapter. Voici mon plan.</p>

<p>La première chose que j&#8217;ai eu à faire c&#8217;est savoir de combien j&#8217;ai besoin pour vivre la vie que je veux vivre. Je travaille depuis que j&#8217;ai 16 ans au restaurant d&#8217;abord, puis à franprix et maintenant en tant que développeur. Pourtant je n&#8217;avais jamais réussi à mettre des sous de côté jusqu&#8217;à ré
cemment. Je vivais au jour le jour avec tous les mois un compte repartant de 0 euro. Une fois arrivé proche de ce nombre. Je commençais à faire plus attention. Le problème de cela c&#8217;est que le jour ou un de mes proches aura besoin d&#8217;aide financière je serais incapable de la lui fournir. Tout d&#8217;abord toujours avoir 1 mois sur son salaire en réserve. Ce 1 mois n&#8217;est toutefois pas assez sécurisant. Je veux maintenant augmenter ce coussin à 6 mois puis 1 an.</p>

<blockquote><p>Règle numéro 1 toujours avoir un apport de 1 mois minimum.</p></blockquote>

<p>Certains m&#8217;ont répondu à quoi bon économiser, tu n&#8217;emporteras pas ton argent dans ta tombe. Sauf que si cet argent peut m&#8217;éviter de finir dans une tombe ce n’est pas plus mal. Demain, je parlerais de comment faire pour avoir plus d&#8217;argent.</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>En ce moment, peu importe avec qui je discute, je finis par lui demander quel est son but. Étant moi même en pleine remise en question. C’est intéressant de voir que peu importe l’âge, le niveau social, personne n’est jamais totalement sûr de son choix. Nous sommes pleins de doutes, d’incertitudes. Cette appréhension est constamment présente, mais le facteur rendant ce doute bon ou mauvais pour soi est le pessimisme ou l’optimisme qui l’accompagne.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>La raison pour laquelle l’optimisme est l’une des qualités que je scrute en premier chez une personne est qu’elle apporte de l’espoir. Prenez une personne voulant négocier son salaire. Si pessimiste, elle partira perdante. Elle sera déjà battue mentalement voir tant résignée qu’elle ne prendra même pas la peine de passer à l’action. Se plaindra intérieurement, ou transmettra cela à son entourage. Sans agir.</p>

<p>Au contraire, la personne optimiste tentera dans tous les cas avec l’aura positive et attrayante qu’il faut. Avec l’état d’esprit d’avoir la promotion.</p>

<p>Le grand peut-être est une théorie (de ma tête). C’est ce grand peut-être qui me pousse à agir lorsque je suis épuisé. Ne me sens pas l’envie de sortir, ou de faire, d’agir et préfère ne rien faire. Tout ceci dans l’espoir que peut-être vais-je vivre un moment inoubliable. Cela est possible uniquement en étant optimiste.</p>

<p>Nous sommes nés avec une mémoire vide. Cette mémoire au fur et à mesure du temps s&#8217;est remplie de souvenirs, d&#8217;expériences et de savoirs. Ce dernier élément est pour moi séparé en 3 grandes parties.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ce que je sais, que je sais.</li>
<li>Ce que je sais, que je ne sais pas.</li>
<li>Ce que je ne sais pas, que je ne sais pas.</li>
</ol>


<!-- more -->


<h1>Ce que je sais, que je sais.</h1>

<p>Celui-ci est simple, je sais que je sais marcher, lire le français, programmer. Il regroupe tout ce que nous sommes capables de faire.</p>

<h1>Ce que je sais, que ne sais pas.</h1>

<p>Je sais que je ne sais pas (encore) parler arabe, jouer de la guitare, faire un salto, la cuisine. Il regroupe ma perspective du monde et des possibilités qui me sont connus. Je peux donc quand je le souhaiterais les apprendre (au moment opportun).</p>

<h1>Ce que je sais, que je ne sais pas.</h1>

<p>Celui-ci est celui que la plupart d&#8217;entre nous ignorent. Ils ne prennent pas en compte, ainsi que le plus difficile à expliquer. Par exemple, je ne savais pas que je pouvais prendre soin de moi sans médicaments. Que je pouvais me prévenir d&#8217;être malade avant de démarrer l&#8217;étude du Shiatsu. Je pensais aussi qu&#8217;être timide était un fait et non pas quelque chose sur lequel je peux avoir le contrôle quand je le souhaite. Je ne savais pas qu&#8217;être bon scolairement n&#8217;était pas une question d&#8217;intelligence ou même de manque de détermination, mais un manque d&#8217;habitude.</p>

<p>Ce troisième élément du savoir donne de la perspective à ma vision des choses. Je vis dans le désir de découvrir toute ces choses que je ne connais pas. Dont je n&#8217;ai même pas idée de l&#8217;existence. Qui est hors de ma portée, de mon champ de vision.</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>La photo est un banc au Bangladesh ou j&#8217;ai pris l&#8217;habitude de m&#8217;asseoir. Place surnommée la place des vents. Avoir un ventilateur est un luxe pour certains. Ils ne savent pas qu&#8217;ils ne savent pas que nous avons des bâtiments entiers dont la température est régulée ici.</p>

    <id>http://philippetring.fr/blog/2015/05/18/mesurer-son-evolution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/evaluer-sa-vie.jpg"></p>

<p>Un ami m’a conseillé d’écrire sur le changement en prenant le bus. La fin d’année approche… Pour beaucoup de mes proches, cela marquera la fin de la vie étudiante et le début de la vie active. Pour mon ancienne prof de français, le début de la retraite. C’est souvent le moment de remise en question. Avec le temps vient progression. Mais sur quoi se baser pour évaluer sa vie?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>L&#8217;argent</h1>

<p>Le premier critère qui me vient à l&#8217;esprit est le salaire, après tant d’années à ne vivre avec rien sur les bancs de l’école et l’argent des parents, être enfin payé comme un “grand”, les entretiens annuels au sein de l’entreprise sont les récompenses pour cette année de bons et loyaux services. Atteint rapidement néanmoins un moment où l’argent ne suffit plus. Je ne gagne pas beaucoup d’argent, mais assez de quoi aider ma famille, me payer ce que je souhaite, économiser pour voyager, pas dans le luxe certes, mais voyager. Je me sens bien lotie pour un étudiant.</p>

<p>Viendra ensuite l’envie d’acheter sa propre maison. Voulant voyager à travers le monde c’est la dernière idée d’investissement que je fais de mon argent. Préférant ma liberté, je me rends compte après avoir parlé avec beaucoup de personnes plus âgées que moi que beaucoup voir tous m’ont recommandé de voyager tant qu’il est encore temps. Voyager de façon aussi libre en dormant dans un hamac est probablement réalisable à n’importe qu’elle âge si notre santé le permet, mais viennent les responsabilités qui grandissent avec l’âge. Plus j’avance et moins je me sens prêt à être grand. Si cela signifie être contraint par un loyer, un endettement, des horaires. De plus, j’en profite pour apprécier le fait de pouvoir faire l’école buissonnière sans autre répercussion qu’une réprimande si j’en viens à être pris sur le fait.</p>

<p>À côté de cela, ma cousine va avoir un enfant, à 28 ans. Je suppose que c’est l’âge normal pour avoir un enfant, elle a aussi déjà son appartement, et je crois qu’ils ont chacun leur voiture. Je ne juge pas ce mode de vie ici, je dis simplement qu’il ne me convient pas à moi. Je n’aurais pas éternellement la force de porter un sac de 10 kg sur mes épaules, alors autant le faire tant que c&#8217;est encore possible.</p>

<p>Après la lecture du livre Remote de 37signals, je rêve de pouvoir travailler depuis n’importe où à travers mon ordinateur. Ces derniers temps, je me dis que je pourrais même écrire un livre. Peut-être qu’il n’aidera personne, ou que personne ne le lira. Mais peut-être aussi qu’une personne le lira et qu’il changera sa vie. En parlant d’optimisme, si nous gagnions 1 euro pour chaque bonne pensée et en perdions 1 pour  chaque pensée négative. Serions-nous aussi négatifs ?</p>

<h1>Qu’est-ce que nous sommes censés avoir accompli à 22 ans ?</h1>

<p>Si je ne peux pas me baser sur l’argent pour suivre ma progression et ce sur quoi la société ma proposé de me comparer, sur quoi puis-je me baser ? Le premier baromètre qui me vient en tête est la santé. Qui à 22 ans est en mauvaise santé, me direz-vous ? Tout le monde, du moins beaucoup d’entre nous. Nous n’avons pour la plupart pas les 4 heures à accorder à une activité physique. Est-ce simplement, car nous sommes trop feignants, nous préférons être assis devant un écran.</p>

<p>Le second baromètre est nos relations. À 22 ans nous devrions avoir trouvé quelques personnes qui vous tienne à coeur, avec lesquels partager joie et tristesse tout simplement. Certaines personnes s’en iront, d’autres arriveront, trouver ceux qui resteront. Pour cela, il sera nécessaire d’acquérir de l’intelligence sociale.</p>

<blockquote><p>Parfois, cela commence juste par dire bonjour à quelqu’un.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bonne nouvelle tout n’ait pas trop tard, je n’ai compris l’importance d’avoir des attaches que très tard dans ma vie (et non mes amis sur internet ne comptait pas pour moi, bien que très divertissant), et n’ai commencé a me remettre en forme physiquement que très tard. Et l’influence de mes proches fait que je mange de mieux en mieux !</p>

<p>Enfin nous devrions commencer à penser qu’elle est le but de notre vie. Une question difficile, je commence pour ma part par voir ce que je ne veux pas faire. En espérant trouver ce que je veux faire. Essayer des choses, plein, des stupides, des grandes, des petites, des choses qui nous paralysent, nous font peur. Essayer d’apprendre une nouvelle langue, de jouer d’un instrument, d’écrire, dessiner, sourire à un étranger, chanter, danser.</p>

<p>Nous pouvons regarder en arrière compter le nombre d&#8217;années que nous avons vécues ou compter le nombre de souvenirs que nous avons. Le seul baromètre est celui que l’on se donne. Quels sont vos baromètres?</p>

<p>Note à moi-même : JE PEUX LE FAIRE !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/traiter-comme-amis.jpg"></p>

<p>Jeudi dernier, j’étais dans le métro et une femme dans le métro avait des dragibus, je lisais tranquillement dans le carré qu’offre le wagon puis elle m’en a proposé un. <strong>La spontanéité</strong>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>C’est une chose que j’aimerais développer chez moi. Je connais un ami où qu’il aille ce rappel du prénom des gens et écoute réellement les gens. Lorsqu’on lui demande comment il va, il répond et retourne la question de telle façon qu’on ne peut répondre qu’avec sincérité. J’ai parfois des sursauts de spontanéité, je vais voir le papa qui fait la vaisselle et je lui fais un câlin. Chez <a href="http://www.easi-crm.com/qui-sommes-nous/">easiware</a>, nous avons une private joke &ldquo;cette semaine c’est la semaine du love”. Comme chaque semaine !</p>

<p>Je me demande comment se passer les interactions post-internet, nous avons le monde à notre portée joignable par une suite de numéros, par messages, mais nous avons peur de l’autre. L’une des plus grandes révélations que j’ai eues suite à mon périple en vélo c’est la bienveillance des gens. Beaucoup de gens m’ont accueilli chez eux, ou offert nourriture et eau. Quant aux rares refus, la réponse que j’ai obtenue était</p>

<blockquote><p>“J&#8217;ai <strong>peur</strong> que non”. (I&rsquo;m afraid no)</p></blockquote>

<p>Traiter les gens comme des amis, c’est ce que je vais essayer de faire plus souvent. Me souvenir du prénom de quelqu’un, ses gouts. Réellement, écouter une personne plutôt que préparer ce que je veux dire pour les impressionner. Tenter de dépasser le simple bonjour ça va, aborder des sujets qu’ils n’ont pas eu l’occasion d’aborder avec tous le monde. Les habitudes les plus anodines sont les plus importantes.</p>

<p>Je me souviens de la deuxième nuit de mon excursion en vélo, il était tard et je ne savais pas où dormir. Arrivé devant l’écurie des LERAT, j’étais prêt à payer une chambre, mais ils n’avaient plus de chambres. Je leur ai demandé si cela faisait longtemps qu’ils avaient leurs écuries puis une discussion en amenant une autre, ils m’ont proposé de m’installer dans leur jardin. Je n’avais pas de tente, mais un hamac, ils m’ont donc proposé leur grange. Puis j’écrivais simplement dans mon calepin en regardant les chevaux, puis les enfants des LERAT m’ont proposé de venir boire un verre. Quelques heures plus tard la nuit tombée je partageais un barbecue et coupais du bois pour la première fois de ma vie. Traitais une personne comme un ami, elle fera de même. Donner, donner encore et toujours.</p>

<p>PS: Marmotte et montgolfière !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/minimalisme.jpg"></p>

<p>Ces dernières années, j’essaye de me débarrasser de ce que je trouve superficiel. Tant dans mes habitudes, ma garde-robe, mes pensées. Tout cela est regroupé sous le terme de “minimaliste”. Pour moi, cela consiste à rendre sa vie plus simple.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Moins c’est mieux” &ndash; Rework de 37 signals</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Plusieurs types de minimalistes.</h1>

<p>Le minimalisme de biens. Acheter ou posséder que ce qui est nécessaire, réduire ses biens pour augmenter sa liberté et ne pas être attaché à des choses matérielles, augmenter ses expériences. Avoir moins de choix permet d’être plus heureux, c’est ce qui est expliqué dans “The paradox of choice”. L’écrivain explique pourquoi nous ne serons jamais satisfaits de nos achats. Trop de choix, il y’a toujours quelque chose de mieux chez le voisin. Dans 1 an après mes études et pour mon départ en voyage. J’ai comme objectif de limiter mes possessions à 1 sac pouvant rentrer en cabine d’avion. Je me suis fixé comme poids 8kg. (Quand on marche longtemps, autant marcher avec le moins de poids sur soi !)</p>

<p>Le minimalisme de pensée. Écrire dans mon calepin tout ce que j’ai à faire, stocker toutes mes ressources sur Evernote, avoir ma boite email vide, les mails dans leurs dossiers en attente, action requise, archives ou poubelle. Tout cela me permet de me libérer l’esprit, ne pas être constamment préoccupé par un “Est-ce que j’ai oublié quelque chose?”. Mon attention peut ainsi se porter pleinement sur l’action en cours, le moment présent.</p>

<p>J’aime à penser que tout ce que l’on fait dans la vie est lié à un autre domaine, que tous les domaines se rejoignent. Être minimaliste c’est aussi aller à l’essentiel, être clair et explicite. Mieux apprécier le peu de choses que l’on possède et ne pas être attristé de ce que l’on perd. Choisir expériences plutôt que biens. La semaine prochaine (mardi ou mercredi), je me débarrasserai de mes vêtements inutilisés. C’est noté dans mon calepin !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/pour-qui-ecrire.jpg"></p>

<p>15 jours que j’écris, parmi les articles il y’en a que j’aime, mais surtout beaucoup que je n’aime pas ou trouve ennuyeux. Je dirais que la proportion est de 20/80. Hola, <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principe_de_Pareto">loi de Pareto</a> ! Peu importe, à l’heure actuelle je me concentre sur créer un automatisme. Néanmoins, je commence à trouver un pattern, mon gabarit dans l’écriture.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Une introduction peut parler de tout et de rien, mais doit donner le thème, les grandes lignes de mon article, même si je finis tout le temps par dériver !</p>

<p>Vient ensuite le corps du texte, il ne faut pas qu’il soit trop long, non adapté au web. Une des idées d’amélioration de mon blog serait de rajouter un temps de lecture comme sur Medium. La formule serait le nombre de mots divisé par le nombre de mots qu’une personne moyenne lit par minute.</p>

<p>Sur le style. À qui est-ce que j’écris? Dans certains articles, je voulais paraitre… Le paraitre, avoir l’air cool ! Ça me fait penser à une phrase</p>

<blockquote><p>“I’m much more interesting on the internet”.</p></blockquote>

<p>J’ai ouvert ce blog pour mon E-réputation. Montrer aux entreprises que j’ai de la valeur. J’ai ensuite mis en ligne chaque article que j’écris et dis à tous mes proches mon <a href="http://philippetring.fr/blog/2015/05/01/ecriture-et-peur/">challenge</a> pour avoir un moyen de pression sociale, motivation et m’y tenir. Maintenant, j’écris pour moi et plus le temps passe et plus je me dis que la personne que je veux réellement atteindre c’est LA soeur.</p>

<p>En espérant que mes pensées te guident, garde un oeil critique sur tout ce que j’écris. Ce n’est qu’un reflet d’état de pensée à 22 ans. Prends ce qui te parait juste et laisse le reste ! J’ai lu l’autre jour dans les cinq plus grands regrets au moment de la mort qu&#8217;un des plus grands regrets des gens en mourant était de ne pas avoir passé de temps avec leurs proches.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/pratiquer-une-activite-physique.jpg"></p>

<p>Il y’a 2 ans de cela, je démarrais une activité physique dans le but de retrouver une santé disparue après 20 ans assis devant un écran !</p>

<blockquote><p>To keep the body in good health is a duty&hellip; otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear. &ndash; Bouddha</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Pourquoi faire une activité physique ?</h1>

<p>Hier, je parlais de <a href="http://philippetring.fr/blog/2015/05/13/meditation/">méditation</a> et des bienfaits. Il existe aujourd’hui des centaines d’études sur l’impact de pratiquer une activité physique régulière pour une meilleure santé, meilleure productivité, meilleure concentration, meilleure humeur et même avoir plus d’énergie. Je ne me suis jamais sentie aussi bien qu’après une bonne séance !</p>

<h1>Pourquoi les arts martiaux ?</h1>

<p>Ayant pour but de voyager à long terme, je me doute des risques que cela peut inclure et j’ai toujours voulu savoir me protéger moi et mes proches. Mais en étant réaliste, les probabilités pour que je me batte sont proches du néant, toutes les situations pouvant être calmées avec des mots. Néanmoins, le gain de confiance en soi m’ont était très utile, de plus les arts martiaux dans leurs aspects traditionnels nous apprennent des leçons de vie. Comme le rejet de l’égo, mais par contre je déteste porter un keikogi, le kimono de mon école !</p>

<h1>Pourquoi le Ninjutsu ?</h1>

<p>Mon école est divisée en 4 grandes branches :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>L’Académie des Sports de Combats et Arts Martiaux qui instruit aux arts martiaux, Nin-Jutsu (qui est l’art que pratiquait les Ninjas dans le temps) et Ju-Jutsu. Le programmé a était fait de manière à y aller petit à petit. Au départ, nous reprenons le contrôle de notre corps à travers le mouvement. Apprendre à se déplacer, remettre en forme son corps. Le travail avec un partenaire n’est vu que quelques niveaux plus loin. Au départ de loin, puis au fur et à mesure des niveaux en se rapprochant de la personne. L’ensemble est équilibré, nous travaillons notre force avec des exercices de musculation, notre agilité à travers des mouvements qui demande la coordination de tous nos membres, et notre endurance pendant la séance.</p></li>
<li><p>Le Second Cercle des Arts Méditatifs de l’Aka qui perpétue les techniques de méditation.</p></li>
<li><p>Le Centre d’Apprentissage du Shiatsu et des Méthodes Associées qui forme au Shiatsu et au soin d’autrui. Qui sont des techniques tiré de la médecine traditionnelle</p></li>
<li><p>L’Association des Mouvements de Santé de l’Aka Chûshin qui diffuse les gymnastiques de santé.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Une séance de ninjutsu dans mon école se déroule ainsi :</p>

<ol>
<li>2-5 minutes de gymnastique de santé (un Goshin Tai So). Un enchainement de mouvements bénéfique pour le corps. Très bon exercice à faire tous les jours !</li>
<li>20-30 minutes d’échauffements, de cardio et de renforcement musculaire. Courir, sauter, pomper, lutter, combat avec pied et poings !</li>
<li>10-15 minutes d’esquives par déplacement du corps. C’est la première chose que l’on apprend en venant au Ninjutsu. Apprendre à connaitre son corps et se mouvoir. Les esquives par déplacement du corps sont divisées en 3 parties. Les techniques de terre, ciel et entre terre et ciel. Rouler, chuter (terre), faire l’équilibre, la roue, et plus tard faire des saltos (ciel), sauter de haut et se réceptionner, courir sur les murs (entre terre et ciel), le tout sans se blesser !</li>
<li>Finalement, chacun travaille les techniques de son liés à son degré (niveaux, représentés par la ceinture). Il y’a 10 degrés avant la ceinture noire.</li>
</ol>


<p>Enfin, peu importe, l’art martial que vous pratiquez trouvait un endroit (et surtout des gens) qui vous plait. J’ai la chance de côtoyer des gens tous plus intéressants les uns que les autres dans mon club. C’est la raison pour laquelle j’y suis resté !</p>

<p>Enfin même si vous ne faites pas un art martial, une activité sportive c’est indispensable. Alors, trouvez quelque chose qui vous plait ! Sur ce, je cours. Je vais être en retard au dojo !</p>

<p>PS: Si vous souhaitez essayer le <a href="http://ascam-ninjutsu.fr/">Ninjutsu</a>, vous pouvez venir, on vous accueillera gentiment ! Laisser un petit message</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/meditation.jpg"></p>

<p>J’essaye de méditer depuis quelque temps. <em>Méditer</em> cela peut paraitre ésotérique. Au départ, je m’imaginais un homme flottant à quelques cm au-dessus du sol ou sous une cascade. Mais prenons cela comme un passe-temps, un moyen de se relaxer&hellip; En beaucoup mieux !</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Méditer, pourquoi faire?</h1>

<p>Tout le monde sait à présent qu’il est bon pour la santé de pratiquer une activité sportive au moins 2 fois par semaine. Pour huiler la machine qu’est notre corps. De la même manière je crois que dans les années à venir tous le monde se rendra compte des bénéfices de méditer. Pour remplir le moteur qu’est notre esprit, voir l’améliorer. Après tous, nous sommes tous à un certain degré névrotique, psychotique ou borderline. Nous éloignons nos problèmes de santé physique, qu’attendons-nous pour nos problèmes mentaux.</p>

<p>Lorsque je parle de renforcer le mental, je n’entends pas par là être plus intelligent, mais plus sage. Non pas que je ne sois aucun des deux. En fonction des situations qui se présentent, de prendre la bonne décision en étant serein. Apprécier ce que l’on possède (gratitude) et voir le bon côté des choses (optimisme).</p>

<h1>Méditer, comment faire?</h1>

<p>Concentrez-vous sur ce qui se passe dans votre corps tout en respirant. <strong>C’est tout</strong> ! Le plus simple est d’adapter une respiration ventrale. On peut parler indéfiniment des multiples postures, d’autre moyen de concentrer son attention sur l’extérieur plutôt que sur soi, se tenir droit, détendu. Pour démarrer, prenez un temps qui vous semble acceptable et respirer.</p>

<p>Ensuite, vous allez probablement commencer à penser à autre chose, dès que vous vous en rendez compte reconcentrez-vous sur votre respiration abdominale. Vous pouvez pratiquer cela n’importe où, n’importe quand. 30 secondes ou 30 minutes. Le tout sans obligation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/pensee-limitante.jpg"></p>

<p>Étant petit j&#8217;étais un élève moyen. Moyen en sport, moyen en français, dans à peu près toutes les catégories. Aujourd&#8217;hui, je me rends compte que le simple fait de me dire ça était le problème. Je me limitais moi même.</p>

<blockquote><p>I know I can be what i wanna be be if i work hard at it i&rsquo;ll be where i wanna be &ndash; Nas</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>J&#8217;ai lu un article sur la différence entre un état d&#8217;esprit statique (Static mindset) et un état d&#8217;esprit évoluant (Growth mindset). Les personnes ayant un état d&#8217;esprit dit statique ont tendance à se reposer sur leurs facilités et s&#8217;arrêter dès lors que la tâche devient ardue. Au contraire, les personnes ayant un état d&#8217;esprit évoluant ont tendance à persister, car pour eux tout est apprenable, peut-être acquis avec du travail.</p>

<p>La bonne nouvelle, c&#8217;est que l&#8217;on peut changer d&#8217;état d&#8217;esprit. S&#8217;en rendre compte est un premier pas. Raire et agir est le suivant ainsi que le plus compliqué. Surtout lorsque l&#8217;on a pris l&#8217;habitude de s&#8217;asseoir devant l&#8217;ordinateur et joué aux jeux vidéo durant les 15 premières années de sa vie. Je le répète ce ne sera pas facile, mais si c&#8217;était facile tout le monde le ferait. Je crois en moi, et je vais y arriver !</p>

<p>La nouvelle encore meilleure (C&#8217;est ce qui est bien avec moi, c&#8217;est qu&#8217;il n’y’a pas une bonne et une mauvaise nouvelle, mais une bonne et une encore meilleure nouvelle huhu). C&#8217;est que toi aussi tu peux apprendre ce que tu souhaites. Cela demande du temps, de la motivation (au début), enfin de se créer un système, un automatisme, une habitude.</p>

<p>Mon système à moi ce sont mes challenges que je me donne tous les mois. Je ne sais plus qui a dit qu&#8217;il vaut mieux donner 1000 coups de poing pendant 1000 jours que 1000 coups de poing en 1 jour (bonus pour 1000 coups de poing pendant 1000 jours). Bruce Lee !</p>

<p>Et toi qu&#8217;aimerais tu savoir faire? Faire un challenge à plusieurs c&#8217;est toujours plus motivant !</p>

    <id>http://philippetring.fr/blog/2015/05/11/la-vie-est-elle-assez-longue</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/la-vie-est-elle-longue.jpg"></p>

<p>Aujourd’hui, j’essaye une nouvelle façon d’écrire : Freestyle. Laisser ma pensée coulée. Ce week-end j’ai cassé mon téléphone. Un vieux Nokia avec un clavier T9. Un des clairs avantages de ne pas avoir un smartphone, c’est que lorsque l’on le casque on s’en moque. À côté de cela, j’ai perdu beaucoup de contact. Je payerais bien 100 euros pour les retrouver et les synchroniser en moins d’une minute. Je sais pas encore ou tout ça va me mener, mais bon je raconte juste ma vie en attendant que l’inspiration vienne… Trouvé, passer sa vie attacher a ses affaires.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Ce qui me ferait vraiment peur avec un smartphone c’est que je serais probablement en train de jouer plutôt que d’écrire dans le métro. À ce propos, la dame à côté de moi me regarde bizarrement, mais je survivrais ou vous ne lirez jamais ces lignes. Concentre-toi Philippe. Pour revenir au smartphone.</p>

<blockquote><p>Être celui qui contrôle la technologie et non pas celui qui est contrôlé par celle-ci.</p></blockquote>

<p>La raison pour laquelle je tiens tant à ne pas avoir de smartphone, et ne pas être trop devant l’écran est que je pense avoir compris la valeur du temps. Seneque dans son bouquin The shortness of life (j’aime vraiment trop ce bouquin, petit, mais plein de pépites) dit :</p>

<blockquote><p>La vie est longue, si tu sais comment l’utiliser.</p></blockquote>

<p>Du moins un truc dans ces lignes-là. J’ai passé les premières années de ma vie d&#8217;adulte à regarder passer ma vie au lieu de la <strong>VIVRE</strong>. Clairement aujourd’hui je vais au travail pour être payer moins que ce que je gagnais à servir des gens au restaurant. Mais au moins, je vais apprendre quelque chose qui m&#8217;est utile. J’essaye au maximum d’investir mon temps dans des choses qui apporteront de la valeur à ma vie. Probablement l’une des raisons pour lesquelles j’ai tant de mal à travailler sur mon projet à l’école, car je sais qu’il m’apporte très peu pour l’investissement que j’y mets ! Ce n’est pas la durée de la vie qui est en cause. Si la durée de la vie était de 300 ans en moyenne, est-ce que la plupart d’entre nous accompliraient plus de choses ? Nous passerions probablement plus de temps à nous dire que nous avons le temps.</p>

<p>Dites-moi sur quoi comptez-vous passer votre temps, peut être que ça me donnera des idées.</p>

<p>PS: Je n’ai jamais écrit un article aussi vite, je suis rentré dans ce que beaucoup appelle le “flow”. Un concept qui mérite un article d’ailleurs. Après relecture, j’aime bien cet article. Heureusement, car les articles des derniers jours ne me plaisaient pas.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/la-fois-ou-jai-pleure.jpg"></p>

<p>Voyager seul est devenu mon option par défaut pour voyager. J’aime être libre et ne pas dépendre de quelqu’un d’autre. Cela a l’air facile de prendre son sac et partir à l’aventure, mais saviez-vous que j’ai pleuré la première fois que je suis parti seul en Inde?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>En 2013, je partais pour l’Inde, j’ai rencontré Brett mon correspondant dans le train vers CDG. Durant mon trajet en avion, je lisais le routard sur l’Inde surtout le passage à propos des innombrables arnaques ayant cours à Delhi. Mon frère devait me rejoindre dans 27 heures plus tard. Ce qui me laisser 27 heures livré à moi même. J’avais décidé de ne pas prendre de taxi à la sortie de l’aéroport voulant visiter la ville et aimant marcher. C’était sans compter sans les multiples abordages dont je ferais l’épreuve une fois sortie. Mon sac à dos de 60L n’aidant pas à ne pas être repéré je ne pouvais pas marcher sans qu’un Indien viennent à moi me demandant ou j’allais, je commençais par les ignorer. Puis finis par parler à l’un d’entre eux en anglais lui disant que je me rends à l’office du tourisme. Il me propose de m’emmener en Tuk tuk gratuitement, un moyen de locomotion populaire chez eux. Je finis par accepter.</p>

<p>S’en suit mon arrivée dans l’office de tourisme qui se trouve finalement être une agence de voyage local proposant des tours tout compris de l’Inde à destination de touriste. Ne sachant pas comment réagir. je discute nonchalamment avec eux. Il me propose des tours un peu partout en Inde en fonction de mes envies, je leur dis que je déciderais plus tard lorsque mon frère sera arrivé. Que pour le moment je veux uniquement aller dans mon hôtel. L’ambiance était vraiment étrange j’avais peur. Je ne savais pas si je pouvais leur faire confiance. Après 2 heures de discussion ils finissent par me dire que l’hôtel que j’avais réservé avec mon frère est mal fréquenté et dangereux que beaucoup de touristes se font attaquer dans ce quartier. Ils me proposent un autre hôtel pas cher beaucoup plus sûr.</p>

<p>Fatigué, et commençant à craquer je leur dis d’accord pour voir leur hôtel. Je repars donc dans une autre voiture. Ne voulant pas lâcher mon sac à dos je rentre dans la voiture. On me présente à un chauffeur et je suis accompagné d’une personne assez opulente en charge de m’accompagner à l’hôtel appelons le “Iqbal&#8221;. Suite à la visite de l’hôtel, je leur demande de me déposer à l’hôtel que j’ai réservé, et ils finissent par craquer voyant que je ne suis littéralement une boule de stress. Mais ils me laissent à 2 rues de l’hôtel, car l’endroit est trop dangereux selon eux pour y aller. Hésitant, ayant peur de me faire agresser dans la rue je finis par retourner à l’agence de voyages.</p>

<p>S’en suit une autre très longue conversation, eux tentant de me vendre un tour en Inde, etc. Je finis par accepter leur hôtel. Iqbal m’accompagne à l’hôtel et durant le trajet je fonds en larme n’en pouvant plus. Touché, Iqbal me ramène à leur hôtel et passes un peu de temps avec moi dans la chambre, nous discutons et finiront par nous lié je me souviens avoir chanté Jason Mraz &ndash; I’m yours (je chante quand je vais mal, et de manière générale !). Finalement nous nous rendons à l’aéroport chercher mon frère, mais il ne sort pas. Je finirais par le retrouver quelques heures plus tard grâce à un mail envoyé.</p>

    <id>http://philippetring.fr/blog/2015/05/09/comment-etre-unique</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/be-uniq.jpg"></p>

<p>Suite à mon article sur la lecture hier, j’ai un peu cogité. J’ai eu tendance à reposer toute mon éducation sur ce que l&#8217;école m&#8217;a appris. Plus j’avance, plus je me rends compte qu’après l’école l’apprentissage ne fait que commencer.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Pourquoi me restreindre à ce que j’apprends durant une formation, à l’école? Nous démarrons l’école avec une perspective subjective de plusieurs sujets, puis nous devons choisir parmi ces sujets qui seront notre étiquette pour le restant de notre vie, notre métier, notre voie. Alors que tous les savoirs du monde sont à ma portée. Avec internet, avoir accès à des ressources sur tous les sujets, faire une recherche, trouver le mail d’une personne experte. Commander un bouquin ayant synthétisé le tout pour nous. Lorsque l’on me demande ce que je fais dans la vie, je réponds que je suis programmeur.</p>

<p>Les gens les plus intéressants que je rencontre sont ceux qui en plus de leurs métiers ont des intérêts variés et différents. Ceux qui me donnent envie d’être avec eux font du yoga, l&#8217;entrepreneuriat, de l’acupuncture, du vélo, de la psychomotricité, grimpent, cuisinent, font du théâtre mais ne font pas uniquement cela. Essayer des choses différentes tout le temps. Il y’a tellement de choses à faire pour rester uniquement sur 1 ou 2 domaines (j’essayerais bien la danse classique d’ailleurs, huhu). Avoir toutes ces intersections donne à ces gens tellement plus de facettes au point de vue visible, mais aussi intérieurement, me donne des perspectives différentes. Ces derniers temps, je trouve des corrélations entre la programmation et l’écriture par exemple.</p>

<p>La théorie des 10,000 heures dit qu’il faut 10,000 heures pour être expert dans un domaine, ceci est réalisable en environs 7 ans. Disons que nous mourons vers 70 ans (je suis pessimiste !). Ça nous donne 10 occasions d’être spécialiste dans des domaines différents enlevons à ces 70 ans, 20 ans. Ça revient à 7 laps de temps d’être tout ce que je souhaite. Puis l’on peut apprendre sans pour autant être un expert. Pour apprendre la base sur un sujet, il faut beaucoup moins de temps. Je recommande le livre &ldquo;How to get good at anything in 20 hours” si vous voulez en savoir plus à ce sujet.</p>

<p>Saviez-vous que le MIT donne accès aux vidéos de tous leurs cursus?</p>

<p>Je ne suis pas un lecteur depuis que je suis petit. Étant petit, je détestais lire. Aujourd’hui, je lis quotidiennement. Parfois juste 5 pages parfois une nuit entière. Pourquoi lis-je?</p>

<h1>1. Du savoir prémaché</h1>

<p>Une des choses que j&#8217;ai notées durant ma vie. C’est en étant mentoré d’expert dans un domaine que l’on apprend le plus vite. Prenons la programmation par exemple, j’ai appris tellement en entreprise avec des gens BEAUCOUP plus sage. Leurs savoirs qu’ils ont mis des années à affiner est à notre disposition et la plupart n’attendent que a partagé tout cela. Simplement, tous les mentors ne sont plus vivants et le ratio n’est pas équivalent. C’est ici que les bouquins ont un avantage. Tous ceux qui ont vécu avant nous ont déblayé les forêts ont préparé des routes pour nous faciliter le passage (mauvaise métaphore, je n’aime pas les routes !). Pareil pour les bouquins, ils me donnent une source de savoir. Ils me permettent de ne pas reproduire les erreurs déjà faites auparavant. Voir comment les autres ont accompli ce que je veux accomplir. Peu importe ce qui m’intéresse. Il y’a toujours un bon bouquin dessus. Ne pas réinventer la roue.</p>

<h1>2. Inspiration</h1>

<p>C’est l’occasion parfaite de se mettre dans la tête des plus grands d’y ajouter notre amélioration personnelle pour faire encore mieux. Tout comme être le produit de nos proches. J’essaye de m’entourer des bouquins les plus positives possible. Certains ont probablement était écrit en 2 jours d’autres en 5 ans, peu importe. Imaginer avoir Gandhi pour mentor.</p>

<p>Lire c&#8217;était chiant. Maintenant je vois les bouquins comme des amis/mentors qui ne demandent qu&#8217;a me parler, me raconter leurs vie pour me booster dans la mienne. Sur ce je retourne bouquiner ! Je lis &ldquo;On the shortness of life&rdquo; de Seneca, il est vraiment TOP !</p>

<p>Note à moi même: Demander aux gens ce qu’ils lisent en ce moment lorsque je les rencontres, acheter une kindle.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/150-euros-for-1-month-in-spain.jpg"></p>

<p>Cet été direction l&#8217;Espagne, parcourir le fameux <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A8lerinage_de_Saint-Jacques-de-Compostelle" target="_blank">pèlerinage de Saint-Jacques-de-Compostelle</a> ! Bon moment pour tester sur le terrain mon Espagnol que j&#8217;exerce tous les jours sur <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/iamGnirt" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> depuis 257 jours. 1 mois d&#8217;escapade, le tout pour un budget minimal : 150 euros.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>3 types de dépenses pour un voyage</h1>

<ol>
<li>Transport</li>
<li>Logement</li>
<li>Alimentation</li>
</ol>


<h1>Transport : 0 euro</h1>

<p>Pour les transports faciles, je vais utiliser en majorité mes petits pieds avec mes super sandales Earth Runners pour ceux qui ne me connaissent pas je me promène constamment en tongs. Je vais aussi en profiter pour essayer la marche &ldquo;Namba Aruki&rdquo;, qui est la marche pratiquée par les messagers durant la période Edo(1603-1868). D&#8217;après ce que j&#8217;ai lu, qu’ils pouvaient faire jusqu’à 480km en 6-8 jours !</p>

<p>Bon, la totalité de la route de Compostelle ça va quand même être compliqué il y&#8217;a quand même 1500 km entre les deux et j&#8217;ai que un mois ! Je démarrerais mon périple à pied à la frontière espagnole aux environs d’Irún. Soit un peu plus de la moitié (750km envieront pour atteindre Compostelle). Donc, comment aller jusqu&#8217;en Espagne ? Auto-stop ! Ca sera ma première fois en auto-stop.</p>

<p>D&#8217;autres alternatives pas chères que j&#8217;ai étudié, mais qui me paraissent moins fun. (J&#8217;éditerais peut-être ça si je ne trouve pas de voiture pour me conduire dans le sud !).</p>

<ul>
<li>Vélo (0 euro ou le prix d&#8217;un vélo), mais je serais trop tenté de faire tout le reste de Compostelle en vélo ! Pour le prix j&#8217;avais acheté un vélo à 3 vitesses sur leboncoin qui m&#8217;a emmené en aller-retour de Paris à Londres pour 100 euros (par contre, je déconseille de prendre 3 vitesses c&#8217;était parfois une sacrée épreuve)</li>
<li>Mégabus (26 euros), des bus allant un peu partout en Europe pour vraiment pas chère !</li>
<li>Blablacar (40-70 euros), chouette moyen de se déplacer !</li>
<li>Train (80-120 euros)</li>
<li>Avion (même pas réussi à trouver un prix)</li>
<li>Voler un scoot (finir en prison ou avoir mauvaise conscience), j&#8217;ai hésité&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<h1>Logement : 0 euros</h1>

<p>On ne change pas une équipe qui gagne, je prendrais donc mon hamac et ferais du camping sauvage. Pourquoi se contenter d&#8217;un 5 étoiles quand on en a une infinité au-dessus de la tête? Le plus compliqué c&#8217;est surtout de trouver des douches&hellip; Le courage de demander des douches plus exactement !</p>

<p>Sinon Couchsurfing, ça marche bien !</p>

<h1>Alimentation : 150 euros</h1>

<p>J&#8217;ai pris ma référence avec <a href="http://www.numbeo.com/food-prices/country_result.jsp?country=Spain" target="_blank">google</a> sur le prix de la nourriture. Là pas de recette miracle quoi que&hellip; j&#8217;ai mis 5 euros mais je pense que j&#8217;en aurais pour moins en réalité. Mon secret ? Je partage ma recette pour manger et avoir assez de carburant pour marcher 7 heures par jours.</p>

<ul>
<li>Eau</li>
<li>Flocons d&#8217;avoine</li>
<li>Fruits secs</li>
</ul>


<p>Bonus : Noix/Cacahuètes si possible sans sel, miels, chocolats, laits, fruits (Banane coupée, miam), Bouts de pain, votre imagination.</p>

<p>Une recette dont je ne me lasse pas qui dure des jours et des jours avec des variations incroyables. Le tout sans réchaud, léger (porter 1 kg en plus dans le dos toute la journée, je suis trop flemmard pour ça). Je l&#8217;ai reprise d&#8217;un blog de cyclo tourisme. C&#8217;est super efficace !</p>

<p>Sinon un simple paquet de céréales c&#8217;est bien aussi.</p>

<p>J&#8217;avais écrit une partie appréhensions/questions que l&#8217;on me pose souvent, mais ça commence à être long. Si vous avez des questions, n&#8217;hésitez pas ! Aimeriez-vous plus d’articles sur le voyage? 150 euros, irréalisable?</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>La photo est une route que je trouvais jolie en Angleterre, ce que j&#8217;adore avec les routes c&#8217;est qu&#8217;elles peuvent mener n&#8217;importe où. La route que l&#8217;on prend le matin en sortant de chez soi pour aller au travail peut aussi mener&hellip; En Afrique, en Amérique, en Asie, où vais-je ?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/organisation.jpg"></p>

<p>23h, je n&#8217;ai toujours pas commencé mon article de la journée. Cela me rappelle quand j&#8217;étais au collège et que je faisais toujours mes devoirs la veille (lorsque je les faisais). J&#8217;aime me considérer comme quelqu&#8217;un d&#8217;organisé, mais ces derniers temps il y&#8217;a juste ÉNORMÉMENT de choses en cours. Comment est-ce que je m&#8217;organise ?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>J&#8217;en ai parlé précédemment dans ma <a href="http://philippetring.fr/blog/2015/05/02/habitudes-quotidiennes/">routine quotidienne</a>, mais tous les jours je note 3 choses à faire dans la journée, dont 1 grosse tache dont je m&#8217;occupe en priorité dès que possible. Aujourd&#8217;hui, c&#8217;était faire la landing page de <a href="http://bit.ly/1AFXy1U" target="_blank">Link</a>. Le revers est qu&#8217;il est souvent simple de se contenter de ces 3 choses et de ne pas faire plus. De plus, je passe beaucoup trop de temps sur Youtube, d&#8217;ailleurs je vais enlever tous mes abonnements de ce pas&hellip; J&#8217;en ai laissé 12/94 !</p>

<h1>Lister tout ce qu&#8217;il y&#8217;a à faire</h1>

<p>Pour cela, j&#8217;utilise un simple carnet ou je note tout ce qui me vient à l&#8217;esprit.</p>

<p>En ce moment j&#8217;ai :</p>

<ul>
<li>Shiatsu ayant mon examen hebdomadaire ce week-end et surtout l&#8217;examen de fin d&#8217;année.</li>
<li>Chez <a href="http://easiware.fr/" target="_blank">easiware</a> nous lançons notre nouvelle solution de Marketing Automation en bêta test (on va tout cartonner !).</li>
<li>À Gobelins finir le prototype de <a href="http://bit.ly/1AFXy1U" target="_blank">Link</a>.</li>
<li>Organiser l&#8217;anniversaire d&#8217;un ami la semaine prochaine.</li>
<li>Avancer le blog. En dehors d&#8217;écrire un article par jour, design et marketing donc.</li>
<li>Préparer mon voyage en Espagne cet été.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Planifier une action</h1>

<ul>
<li>Shiatsu: Demain je ferais 5 Testings musculaires.</li>
<li>easiware: Message pour savoir comment je peux aider.</li>
<li>Gobelins: Finir l&#8217;interface pour vendredi soir.</li>
<li>Anniversaire: Appeler les gens, un cadeau.</li>
<li>Créer une newsletter, intégrer des boutons de réseaux sociaux.</li>
<li>Écrire un article sur la préparation de voyage. (Comment voyager 1 mois pour 150 euros)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Enlever les obstacles</h1>

<ol>
<li>Mettre un casque, même sans musique les gens seront moins tentés de vous déranger. Écouter de la musique sans paroles, sinon je finis toujours par chanter. J&#8217;adore <a href="https://lullatone.bandcamp.com/album/soundtracks-for-everyday-adventures" target="_blank">Soundtrack for every adventures</a> et <a href="https://coffitivity.com/" target="_blank">Coffitivity</a></li>
<li>Couper internet quand il est non nécessaire. Pour écrire un article par exemple, et ne pas surfer sur internet pendant 3 heures.</li>
<li>Préparer mon tapis de Yoga pour demain.</li>
</ol>


<p>Ça fait très longtemps que je pense à timesheeter ce sur quoi je passe mon temps avec <a href="https://www.toggl.com/" target="_blank">Toggl</a>.</p>

<p>Et vous comment travaillez-vous ?</p>

<p>PS: Je lis en ce moment <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/" target="_blank">Getting Things Done</a> je vous ferais probablement un article dessus ! Pour être exact, c&#8217;est ma deuxième lecture, ma lecture &ldquo;attentive&rdquo;.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/mal-de-tete.jpg"></p>

<p>Depuis hier soir j&#8217;ai une migraine qui m&#8217;a empêchée de dormir correctement ne pouvant me concentrer sur autres choses. Mais refusant de prendre des médicaments croyant dur comme fer que mon organisme est capable de s&#8217;auto guérir de se genre de misère. J&#8217;en tire néanmoins une leçon.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Une leçon importante à propos de la douleur</h1>

<p>L&#8217;expérience de souffrir est difficile à comprendre sans jamais l&#8217;avoir expérimenté soit même. Nous passons la majorité de notre temps sans douleurs (encore heureux !). A moins d&#8217;avoir un membre cassé ou une douleur récurrente. Quand bien même nous ne prenons pas soin de notre santé en faisant attention à son alimentation, à s&#8217;exercer au quotidien.</p>

<p>La bonne nouvelle est qu&#8217;il y&#8217;a du bon dans cela. Du moins je me refuse à endurer cette douleur sans en tirer quelque chose.</p>

<blockquote><p>Je suis en bonne santé.</p></blockquote>

<p>Cette expérience, celle de la douleur est d&#8217;ailleurs probablement la seule façon d&#8217;apprendre cette leçon. Nous avons parfois besoin de souffrir pour avoir une échelle et nous rendre compte à quel point nous sommes chanceux d&#8217;être en bonne santé.</p>

<p>Vous l&#8217;aurez probablement compris mais mon mal de tête n&#8217;ai pas si terrible pour mériter tout ce texte.</p>

<p>J&#8217;ai eu la chance de rencontrer des gens rétablis de cancer lors d&#8217;évènements organisés par l&#8217;association <a href="https://www.facebook.com/associationsecondlife" target="_blank">Second Life</a>. Les gens n&#8217;ayant jamais souffert ne connaissent et n&#8217;apprécient peut être autant qu&#8217;une personne ayant eu une seconde chance.</p>

<p>Être conscient des bonnes choses que nous avons déjà, se sentir bien en soi, des proches que nous avons. Dans ce cas là, le bonheur provient de la douleur. La douleur n’est donc pas tous le temps une mauvaise chose.</p>

<p>Maintenant je ne dis pas qu&#8217;un mal de tête peut être comparable aux terribles choses que l&#8217;on peut vivre. Mais une simple note pour moi même, malgré les difficultés de la vie, au moins je suis en bonne santé, et je suis reconnaissant pour cela.</p>

    <id>http://philippetring.fr/blog/2015/05/04/religion-thinking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/religion-think.jpg"></p>

<p>La religion est un sujet que j&#8217;ai toujours tenté d&#8217;éviter n&#8217;aimant pas les confrontations, mais étant ici pour me dépasser, voila mon opinion que j&#8217;ai développée suite à une question d&#8217;un ami Chrétien. (Je suis Athée)</p>

<!-- more -->


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dieu c&#8217;est toi, Dieu c&#8217;est moi, Dieu c&#8217;est nous.&rdquo; &ndash; Un homme bourré en soirée</p></blockquote>

<p>Le fait qu&#8217;il soit en état d&#8217;ébriété n&#8217;enlève rien à la valeur que je donne à cette phrase. Je pense que ce que Jésus, Bouddha, Mahomet ont eux aussi réalisé est qu&#8217;ils sont Dieu et ont fait de leurs mieux suite à cette réalisation pour avoir un impact positif sur Terre et ont bien réussi au passage. Jésus à rassemblé les foules bien qu&#8217;il ai fini crucifié. La différence au passage est probablement dans la façon dont ils ont dit les choses, Jésus a dit &ldquo;Je suis Dieu&rdquo; alors que Bouddha a dit &ldquo;Je ne suis rien&rdquo;. Nous sentons beaucoup plus sur de nous a coté d&#8217;une personne n&#8217;étant rien qu&#8217;une personne étant Dieu. Surtout pour les personnes ayant du pouvoir et que Jésus m&#8217;était en mauvaise position.</p>

<p>La où je diffère est que je pense que <strong>nous sommes tous Dieu</strong>. Le simple fait que nous soyons ici vivant relève déjà du miracle. Nous sommes tous rien dans l&#8217;immensité de l&#8217;univers mais en même temps tous Dieu car nous avons tous le pouvoir de changer le monde, le monde de quelqu&#8217;un et donc la possibilité d&#8217;avoir un impact aussi grand que Jésus, Mahomet, Bouddha&hellip; Nous pouvons tous avoir la possibilité d&#8217;expérimenter des émotions positives incroyable, mais aussi des malheurs incomparables. La possibilité de ressentir de l&#8217;excitation que ce soit face à un saut en parachute, en embrassant quelqu&#8217;un, ou en riant à en pleurer.</p>

<h1>Quel est le but de la vie sachant que je ne suis rien et tout à la fois? Pourquoi est-ce que je vis?</h1>

<p>Tout d&#8217;abord le simple fait de ne pas avoir de but rend la vie beaucoup plus intéressante que si il y en avait un. Le but de notre vie aussi cliché que cela puisse paraitre est le sens que l&#8217;on donne à sa vie. Pour ma part c&#8217;est de vivre le plus de beaux moments possible pouvoir ressentir autant de moment d&#8217;amour, de bonheur, et de connexion. Comment évaluer une vie plutôt que via le nombre d&#8217;années vécu? Je préfère évaluer la mienne au nombre de moment dont je me souviendrais avant de mourir ou renaitre. Peut être sommes nous déjà au Paradis, c&#8217;est ensemble que nous pourrons faire de ce monde notre paradis. Peut être que c&#8217;est simplement en faisant sourire une personne aujourd&#8217;hui, l&#8217;écouter, la remarquer. Finalement en tant que Dieu de mon propre univers je vais tenter à mon échelle de façonner le monde comme je le voudrais.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sois le changement que tu veux voir dans le monde &ndash; Gandhi</p></blockquote>

<p>Est-ce que j&#8217;existe vraiment? C&#8217;est un peu la question que je me pose tout le temps dans ma tête, haha. Demain je reviens avec quelque chose de plus terre à terre !</p>

<p>Ps : Peut être que certain vont me prendre pour un fou ou peut être que cela va changer la vision d&#8217;une personne. et ce sera déjà beaucoup pour moi. Toute la beauté de ce monde ! Est-ce que d&#8217;autres personnes on eut des pensées pareilles? N’hésitez pas en commentaire ou à <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#112;&#104;&#x69;&#x6c;&#105;&#x70;&#x70;&#101;&#x74;&#114;&#x69;&#x6e;&#103;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#x70;&#104;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x69;&#112;&#x70;&#101;&#116;&#114;&#105;&#x6e;&#103;&#x40;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;</a> peu importe exprimez vous !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/dear-friends.jpg"></p>

<p>Today is Sunday and every Sunday for several weeks I kept telling myself to answer Brett, my pen pal from Utah. It&rsquo;s funny how a simple encounter can change you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Long story short</h1>

<p>Back in 2014, I was taking the train to the airport. When this lovely couple asks me for direction. Lisa was a florist and Brett own a company. They were in a road trip around Europe. Lisa ended up telling me about signification behind flowers and colors (Which turned out to be fascinating even if I can&rsquo;t remember all of it). 20 minutes later I ended up with Brett&rsquo;s contact after mentally shaking to ask him.</p>

<p>Back from India I emailed him and we started exchanging.</p>

<p>Over the time he kind of became sort of a guru to me. One who enlighten me. On things that were unknown, opening my mind but also supporting me during hard times. Having someone older and wiser you can speak about freely without judging and having a more&hellip; Experimented and different vision would be an advice I&rsquo;d give anyone.</p>

<p>At school I’m working on a project called <a href="http://bit.ly/1AFXy1U">Link</a>. We hope to connect children around the word and make pen palling (Not sure if that word exists but too lazy to check) the new cool. Sharing about their cultures, their beliefs. The idea was mainly inspired from the relationship I’m lucky we have build with Brett.</p>

<h1>Few things have learned out of that</h1>

<blockquote><p>If you want something you&rsquo;ll have to make the first move.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was hesitating when asking for Brett contact and I’m so glad I did. I guess for the most of us there&rsquo;s a predefine life waiting for us (If we are born in a country with easy access to internet). Having a regular 9-5 job that we spend looking at the clock to be at 5 instead of loving most part of it. Ending the day on video game or in a couch in front of the TV using that money we gain to buy more stuff. Or for the most wellborn of us having a heritance.</p>

<p>If we are fine with that&hellip; Default. I guess we can just go with what come towards us. But if we dare for something else we&rsquo;ll have to be proactive about it.</p>

<p>When I search for a pattern in my friends (Only a developer looks for pattern in his friends!). The only thing I can see is that they all are optimistic about their life and future. Last months lots of them had suffered lost, financial debt, breakups, disease but seeing only the best through.</p>

<blockquote><p>My surroundings define me.</p></blockquote>

<p>Es verdad ! They all push me to be a better me everyday, following their paths.</p>

    <id>http://philippetring.fr/blog/2015/05/02/habitudes-quotidiennes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/daily-habits.jpg"></p>

<p>Après lecture de <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/" target="_blank">The power of habits</a> je suis convaincu qu&#8217;une routine le matin et le soir me permet d&#8217;amener un peu d&#8217;ordre et de calme dans ma vie.</p>

<p>Le livre explique comment fonctionne une habitude et comment les changer. Une habitude suit cet ordre là: Un repère (cue) commence une routine puis finis par une récompense (reward).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Ma routine du matin et du soir sont mes deux habitudes qui ont considérablement amélioré ma vie. J&#8217;ai essayé plusieurs variantes durant les dernières années et celle ci est mon préféré pour le moment mais changera probablement.</p>

<h1>Le matin</h1>

<ol>
<li>Mon réveil est fixé à 1 heures avant mon départ prévu. La plupart du temps je me réveille avant mon réveil. Dans tous les cas je prend mon téléphone. (Cue)</li>
<li>Paramètre un chrono de 5 min pour essayer de méditer. Je fais ça depuis décembre maintenant et je n&#8217;ai pas perçu de bénéfice. Mais je vois ça comme un investissement sur le long terme.</li>
<li>Etirement (le dos d&#8217;abord, puis je m&#8217;entraine au grand écart).</li>
<li>Je danse ou met une musique ou souris dans le miroir (Reward !)</li>
<li>Je regarde ma to-do liste et note maximum 3 choses à faire pour aujourd&#8217;hui dans un post-it.</li>
<li>Brossage de dents</li>
<li>J&#8217;ai ensuite un peu de temps pour flâner à la maison avant de partir. Sortie de chez moi je chante sur le chemin du métro (qu&#8217;il pleuve ou pas !).</li>
<li>Arrivé au métro je lis ou écoute un podcast (meilleure invention au monde !) ou ce mois-ci écris dans mon carnet en écoutant <a href="https://lullatone.bandcamp.com/album/soundtracks-for-everyday-adventures" target="_blank">Soundtrack for Everyday Adventures</a> de Lullatone. Il m&#8217;arrive aussi de juste regarder les gens huhu (Creepy !).</li>
<li>Arrivé au travail ou à l&#8217;école je fais un goshin tai so, une gymnastique préventive de santé reçu de mon <a href="http://casma.fr/?p=17" target="_blank">école de Shiatsu</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Je trouve toujours un moment dans ma journée pour faire ma leçon d&#8217;Espagnol sur <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/iamGnirt" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> (ajoutais moi si vous y êtes aussi!).</p>

<h1>Le soir</h1>

<ol>
<li>Douche froide</li>
<li>Dents</li>
<li>15 minutes de lecture minimum</li>
</ol>


<p>Cela peut paraitre simple d&#8217;établir une routine pareille, mais c&#8217;est d&#8217;autant plus simple d&#8217;en sortir. La vie est composé de <strong>rythme</strong>, biorythme, jour/nuit, nycthéméral, dans la danse, dans les arts martiaux ce matin même mon instructeur a tenté de me faire sentir le rythme de mon adversaire. Enfin mes habitudes que je me donne créent et façonnent le rythme que je donne a ma vie.</p>

<p>Choses que j&#8217;aimerais inclure dans le futur:</p>

<ul>
<li>Réviser mes points d&#8217;acupuncture avant de m&#8217;endormir avec des flash cards</li>
<li>Faire un mini workout (pompes, abdos, squats, plank) après l&#8217;étirement</li>
<li>Qu&#8217;est ce que j&#8217;ai appris aujourd&#8217;hui</li>
<li>Prendre un petit déjeuner le matin !</li>
<li>Choisir mes vêtements pour le lendemain</li>
<li>Penser au meilleur moment de ma journée avant de m&#8217;endormir</li>
<li>Votre proposition?</li>
</ul>


<p>L&#8217;article que j&#8217;avais écris au départ était TRES long et contenait beaucoup de détails, j&#8217;ai donc simplement réduit cela au strict minimum. Si vous auriez voulu plus de détails ou aimais cette longueur, laisser le moi savoir dans les commentaires ! Laisser moi aussi savoir qu&#8217;elles sont vos routines.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/write-and-fear.jpg"></p>

<p>Ecrire est un art qui m’a toujours semblé obscur. Il y a quelques mois de cela je démarrais ce blog pensant aux bienfaits d&#8217;écrire.</p>

<p>Synthétisation de la pensée, organisation de son discours, orthographe et conjugaison (Ma bête noire), expression.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Fidèle à moi-même je ne me suis jamais tenu à mon objectif de deux articles par semaine. Il est tellement plus simple pour mon esprit de se sentir &ldquo;trop occupé&rdquo;, &ldquo;trop fatigué&rdquo;, &ldquo;sans inspiration&rdquo;, &ldquo;trop mauvais&rdquo;. Un des principes auxquels je crois et que je tente d&#8217;appliquer est de respecter mes paroles, agir en conséquence. Pour mes proches et mon entourage je m&#8217;y tiens mais très peu pour mes propres mots.</p>

<p>1er Mai, chaque mois depuis quelques années je me donne un objectif par mois à accomplir tous les jours. Pour adopter une nouvelle habitude, ou me débarrasser d&#8217;une mauvaise habitude. Ce mois-ci ce sera l&#8217;écriture :</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ecrire un article de blog par jour&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Créer autant un article qu’un projet implique de se montrer vulnérable à la critique. Chose détesté par mon grand égo préférant se contenter d’assister, consommer et critiquer.</p>

<p>Qu’est ce qui est au programme ?</p>

<p>Introspection, récits de mes voyages, comment je gère mes finances, idées parfois bonnes souvent mauvaises, préparation pour mon tour du monde à pieds, arts martiaux, médecine traditionnelle et développement personnel sont les premières idées me venant en tête.</p>

<p>A demain, vous avez aimé ? Faites le moi savoir et ajouter moi à votre flux RSS !</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>La photo est une rue en Inde ou j&#8217;ai décidé de m&#8217;asseoir et joué de l&#8217;harmonica en attendant que mes compagnons sortent de la boutique (Ne sachant évidemment pas en jouer). Harmonica qui a atterri dans les mains d&#8217;un petit bonhomme dans une épicerie !</p>

<p>S&#8217;asseoir sur une chaise toute la journée est vraiment mauvais. Qu&#8217;en est-il de s&#8217;asseoir sur un ballon d&#8217;exercice ?</p>

<p>Il y a quelques mois de cela, j&#8217;ai remplacé ma chaise de bureau chez <a href="http://easi-crm.com">easiware</a> pour un ballon de fitness. Passant un certain nombre d&#8217;heures à mon bureau je me demandais si cela aurait un impact positif sur ma position mais surtout&hellip; J&#8217;aime essayer des choses nouvelles !</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Santé</h1>

<p>Je ne vais pas vous faire un article sur les bienfaits potentiels d&#8217;un ballon d&#8217;exercice pour le corps. Vous trouverez de multiples ressources à ce sujet qui n&#8217;ont a priori aucune preuve scientifique. Après 2 mois d&#8217;essai, ma constatation est qu&#8217;un ballon de yoga est équivalent à une chaise classique (Asseyez vous 8 heures devant un écran tous les jours sans bouger, peu importe ce sur quoi vous reposez vous aurez mal !). L&#8217;important étant d&#8217;avoir une bonne position en étant assis et de régulièrement bouger !</p>

<p>J&#8217;avais aussi tendance à m&#8217;avachir vers l&#8217;arrière sur une chaise classique (Vous savez comme une larve !). Mais ne disposant pas de dossier cela m&#8217;est dorénavant impossible. Par contre pour le fait de me pencher en avant, ça ne résout absolument rien ! Donc pas de solution miracle. Simplement me rappeler de me redresser lorsque cela m&#8217;arrive.</p>

<h1>Avantages</h1>

<p>Néanmoins plusieurs choses sont agréables :</p>

<ul>
<li>Le fait de pouvoir jump en écoutant une musique entrainante en plein milieu de l&#8217;open-space</li>
<li>Faire le pont (Etirer son dos par la même occasion) pour réfléchir&hellip; ou pas ! Bonus, un animal snappé dans son état naturel. (Clic sur l&#8217;image)<br>
<a href="http://philippetring.fr/images/ball-chair-snapchat.jpg" class="fancybox" title="snap by Tobi "><img src="http://philippetring.fr/images/ball-chair-snapchat-thumb.jpg" alt="snap by Tobi " /></a></li>
<li>Tenter de rester aussi longtemps que possible en équilibre en décollant les pieds du sol.</li>
<li>Pour la gente féminine la possibilité de se frotter l&#8217;entrejambe serait plausible d&#8217;après une testeuse souhaitant garder l&#8217;anonymat. (Faites juste attention aux regards de vos collègues !)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Inconvénients</h1>

<ul>
<li>Pour la gente masculine, vos bijoux familiaux risquent parfois d’être mal placés ! Pas de panique un simple réajustement sera aisé à faire.</li>
<li>Le bruit de votre pantalon contre le ballon qui ressemble étrangement à un pet.</li>
<li>Attention si vous tentez l’aventure vos collègues pourraient avoir tendance à vous déséquilibrer aux moments les plus inattendus !</li>
</ul>


<p>Donc pas de solution miracle pour votre position ! Mais il est vrai que je trouve l’expérience agréable et que je me vois mal retourner à une chaise classique.</p>

<p>Bonne année de la chèvre !</p>

    <link href="http://philippetring.fr/blog/2015/01/18/pensee-nocturne-sur-les-technologies-pour-les-enfants/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-18T21:48:48+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://philippetring.fr/blog/2015/01/18/pensee-nocturne-sur-les-technologies-pour-les-enfants</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/technologies-enfants.jpg"></p>

<blockquote><p>“We refuse to turn off our computers, turn off our phone, log off Facebook, and just sit in silence, because in those moments we might actually have to face up to who we really are.” — Jefferson Bethke</p></blockquote>

<p>Il est impossible de savoir les véritables effets pour les générations à venir d’une enfance sous l’influence des médias digitaux dans nos vies. Pas uniquement l’ordinateur et la télévision. Les Smartphones, tablettes sont dorénavant dans la course.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Avant propos</h2>

<p>Avant de parler de mon point de vue sur cette situation, il est important de comprendre un peu l’auteur (Aka Philippe, moi !). J’ai reçu mon premier portable à l’âge de 18 ans, je n’ai toujours pas de Smartphone à 22 ans et je travaille pourtant dans l’univers (génialissime !) du développement informatique. J’ai un grand passé de geek avant de découvrir d’autres activités qui me plaisent encore plus que de tuer des monstres virtuels ! Par ailleurs, ma présence sur les différents réseaux sociaux est proche du néant. Ma répulsion première pour les nouvelles technologies dans la vie quotidienne vient donc certainement de mon travail (développeur) qui me pousse a passer un certain temps devant mon ordinateur.</p>

<h2>Tout est lié au yin et au yang (La recherche d’un équilibre)</h2>

<p>Savoir utiliser ces nouvelles technos est quoi qu’il en soit indispensable. Je ne donnerai pas les dernières statistiques, mais tous les métiers des nouvelles technos se portent de mieux en mieux et cela ne fait probablement que commencer. La technologie est partout, constamment, alors pourquoi ne pas laisser les enfants baigner dans cette atmosphère à laquelle ils seront de toutes les manières confrontés plus tard ?</p>

<blockquote><p>Constat &ndash; La technologie ne doit pas être interdite.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mais son utilisation devrait être modérée (selon moi). La restriction d’âge est un bon indicateur : 13 ans pour la plupart des réseaux sociaux et encore… Cet âge d’ores et déjà assez difficile au niveau de l’identité. Je ne sais pas si être soumis a une vision idyllique d’autres vies est une bonne chose. Ce monde où chacun est sous son meilleur jour peut être destructeur, surtout à un âge où la confiance en soi n’est pas forcément omniprésente. Sa valeur ne doit pas être calculée en fonction du nombre de likes qu’on reçoit sur une photo ou un tweet.</p>

<blockquote><p>Constat &ndash; La technologie doit être modérée et guidée</p></blockquote>

<p>L’idée qui me dérange le plus est celle des personnes qui perdent le “vrai” contact, par une socialisation uniquement via le numérique. Lorsque j’ai été plongé dans le vrai monde, je partais avec des kilomètres de retard : comment sociabiliser dans des contextes différents d’internet, où nous nous sentons protégés par l’anonymat ?</p>

<blockquote><p>Constat &ndash; La technologie change nos façons de communiquer, mais le contact face à face est et sera toujours présent.</p></blockquote>

<p>Distraction. Combien de sites suis-je tenté d’aller voir dès lors que j’ouvre un ordinateur ou que j’ouvre par simple réflexe pour voir les statuts de différentes personnes (proches ou non) ? Voir les nouvelles vidéos de mes chats préférés ou dernières actualités ?</p>

<blockquote><p>Constat &ndash; Pouvoir avancer dans sa propre vie et non pas être spectateur de celle des autres</p></blockquote>

<p>Acteur ou observateur, consommateur ou créateur ? C’est probablement l’une des idées les plus intéressantes selon moi. Nous pouvons être les personnes qui like une page ou celle qui l’administrent et partagent une cause. Autant que faire ce peut, je veux être du côté des créateurs, ceux qui font avancer les choses par leurs actions. C’est probablement l’idée la plus forte que j’ai réalisé en écrivant ce soir.</p>

<blockquote><p>Constat &ndash; Faire comprendre aux enfants la différence entre les créateurs et les consommateurs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Enfin, comme Béatrice Lartigue me l’a rappelé aujourd’hui lors de sa conférence à Gobelins, avant d’utiliser enfin une technologie, la question a se poser est</p>

<blockquote><p>“A quoi sert-elle? Quel problème résout-elle?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Bonne nuit</p>

<p>Merci à mademoiselle Hénaut pour sa correction orthographique &lt;3</p>

<blockquote><p>“The best thinking has been done in solitude.” – Thomas Edison</p></blockquote>

<p>A quand remonte la dernière fois où vous êtiez seul ?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Je veux dire&hellip; Réellement seul, sans Facebook, Twitter, vous floodant de notifications via votre smartphone à portée de main. Pouvez-vous vous rappellez de ce moment ? La notion de vitesse dans le monde où nous vivons ne laisse que peu de place pour s&#8217;arreter et sentir une fleur. Nous pouvons dorénavant traverser toute la planète en une poignée d&#8217;heures. D&#8217;ailleurs j&#8217;écris moi même cet article depuis un train allant de Paris à Marseille en moins de 4 heures ! Mon conseil après mon <a href="http://philippetring.fr/blog/2014/08/01/jumping-on-my-bike-and-rolling/">trip solitaire en vélo</a> ?</p>

<h2>Prennez du temps pour vous.</h2>

<br><br>


<p>La société m&#8217;a placé sous un mauvais jour le fait d&#8217;être seul. Depuis mon enfance par example, l&#8217;enfant qui mangeait seul à la cantine, ma première pensée était <em>&ldquo;Pourquoi est-il tout seul?&rdquo;</em>. En me baladant à vélo, une question récurrente était : <em>&ldquo;Pourquoi fais tu se voyage tout seul?&rdquo;</em>.
Pourtant la solitude est l&#8217;environnement le plus propice pour&hellip;<br> <strong>Penser</strong>. Sans aucune distraction extérieur durant mon voyage, j&#8217;étais libre de penser comme JE le souhaitais sans influence externe.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” &ndash; Jim Rohn</p></blockquote>

<p>Cette citation me rappel à quel point nous somme influencé par notre entourage, que nous en soyons conscient ou non. Avec tant d&#8217;influence provoqué par les autres (Pub y compris !), <em>comment penser par soi-même ? Comment me former des opinions sur des sujets qui serait réellement mon opinion ? Comment savoir se que j&#8217;attend réellement de la vie ?</em> (Est-ce que je souhaite vraiment avoir un bon boulot, m&#8217;acheter une maison etc). La réponse peut devenir clair avec un peu de répit solitaire.</p>

<p>Vider votre tête avec quelques minutes de <a href="http://calm.com">méditation</a> a était scientifiquement prouvé pour ses vertues lié à la réduction du stress, améliorer la concentration et la mêmoire, augmenter la créativité, etc. Bloquer du temps pour me retrouver me permet aussi de développer mes propres intêrets. Jouer de la guitare, écrire, m&#8217;étirer, lire, apprendre l&#8217;espagnol&hellip; <strong>Le temps est une denrée rare</strong>, utilisons la à bon escient !</p>

<p>Choisir une direction pour ma vie n&#8217;a pas était simple, cela implique des choix et beaucoup de réflexion, le départ est souvent l&#8217;étape la plus dure, mais rester dans la bonne direction n&#8217;est pas chose aisée pour autant. Pour y parvenir, il est important de se <strong>fixer des rendez-vous introspectifs</strong>, faire un bilan régulier (tous les 3 mois pour ma part). Qui ne s&#8217;est jamais retrouvé à regarder en arrière et se dire <em>&ldquo;Wow. Déjà X ans comme le temps passe vite&hellip;&rdquo;</em>. Particulièrement lorsque l&#8217;on vit sa vie en mode automatique avec un train train fixe (Le fameux métro boulot dodo). Rappellez vous ce que vous avez fait ces derniers temps ? Qu&#8217;avez vous accomplis ? Qu&#8217;aimeriez vous améliorer ? <strong>Fixons nous des objectifs !</strong></p>

<p>Pour finir je ne vous dis pas de partir loin de tout en vélo ou encore comme <em>Christopher McCandless</em> dans <em>Into the Wild</em>. Vous découvrir ne demande pas des mesures extrême mais si vous souhaitez vous découvrir, savoir ce que vous souhaitez réellement pour <strong>VOTRE VIE</strong>. Je vous recommande la solitude, vous ne serez pas déçu.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/bike_uk.jpg"></p>

<p>Hey guys! As some of you may know this summer I decided to do a roadtrip during <strong>1 month on my bike alone to United Kindgom</strong> going as far as i can (without injuring myself of course!)</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Actually im leaving my house in few hours but decided to simply make a quick post to share my plans with all my dear fellas ! You might wonder, why am I writing in english today?</p>

<p>Well I really need to improve my english and especially my writing skills. By the way if anybody answer this post and find let&rsquo;s say&hellip; 5 errors in the text, I Philippe TRING swear to take him/her to get a drink ! But I also have a few (but really loved) friends who doesn&rsquo;t read french. Back to the topic here&rsquo;s the plan.</p>

<h1>Date</h1>

<ul>
<li>Departure : 1 august 2014 from Paris.</li>
<li>Return date : 31 august 2014 at Paris. (I&rsquo;ll try not to be late and not to skip first day of school, but can&rsquo;t promise it mommy !)</li>
</ul>


<h1>My path :</h1>

<p>Going from Paris to Dieppe (north of France) then taking the boat. That&rsquo;s as far as my current roadmap show ! Then taking the boat to Newhaven. When landing, first thing get a roadmap of UK.</p>

<p>Then I actually have 4 ideas in my mind depending on how much time do I have left.</p>

<ol>
<li>If I have plenty of time, going to Scotland get a sweet 20 years old whisky (Heard it was sweet ! Maybe an alcohol I finally enjoy ?)</li>
<li>If I have soso of time going to Ireland ! Find a leprechaun, take a selfie with him.</li>
<li>If I have a short amount of time going to the New Forest National Park. Camp some days then go back.</li>
<li>Finally, if I have very few days left go to London. Find a crowded place sing/dance and try to get at least 10 dollars !</li>
</ol>


<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p>How are you going to deal with [insert random statement] ?</p>

<blockquote><p>I believe that we consumme to much energy and time thinking about problem that will never actually happen. When a problem actually happen i&rsquo;ll face it and let me say <strong>There&rsquo;s no such thing as problems, there&rsquo;s only solutions</strong>. Don&rsquo;t take this assumption wrong, I actually did prepare a bit before I get on my bike and go, but sometimes overthinking just kill me. Let&rsquo;s go out of my comfort zone and see what happen ! Even if i&rsquo;m a bit afraid (Probably why I can&rsquo;t sleep even if it&rsquo;s very late !)</p></blockquote>

<p>What are you going to do when you are not biking ?</p>

<blockquote><p>This year i started taking ninjutsu class (Martial Art, I know kinda cliche for an asian to do martial art AND be in CS ! Huehue). So every morning i&rsquo;m going to take 1-2 hours to stretch (things that i already do every morning but only 15 min, one day i&rsquo;ll post a picture of me doing a split !) but also doing the <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=goshin+tai+so">Goshin tai so</a> as my master taught me ! <br> Then finding a shop to buy food, finding a good spot to put my hamac for the coming night. Look at some gorgeous view (Hopefully !) and finally LIVE right here right now ! (Into the wild style !)</p></blockquote>

<p>Ok, that&rsquo;s it for now, almost 3 am in the morning didn&rsquo;t plan to stay that late when i started this post ! But the good thing is I am the one who decide when the train is leaving tomorrow huehue. <strong>I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul &ndash; Invictus.</strong></p>

<p>If you have any questions, comments and remember if anybody answer this post and find 5 errors in the text, I Philippe TRING swear to take him/her to get a drink !</p>

<p>Bonus : The <a href="http://philippetring.fr/blog/2014/08/01/liste-pour-une-balade-en-velo/">full list</a> of what i&rsquo;m bringing with me during my trip. Peace !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://philippetring.fr/images/startup-or-corporate.jpg"></p>

<p>Il y&#8217;a de cela 4 mois j&#8217;int&eacute;grais l&#8217;&eacute;quipe de <a href="http://chictypes.com/">Chictypes</a>, une startup dont l&#8217;aventure a commenc&eacute;e un an de cela. Laissez moi partager avec vous pourquoi je recommencerais sans h&eacute;siter.<br /><br />
<!-- more -->   
<strong>Une ouverture d&#8217;esprit</strong><br /><br />Je n&#8217;ai probablement pas besoin de vous dire que la plupart des startups ne vous payeront pas aussi bien que certaines SSII. Vous (ou votre dipl&ocirc;me) valent certainement plus que ce qu&#8217;une startup est capable de payer. Mais travailler pour une startup offre d&#8217;autres avantages, votre monter en comp&eacute;tence, votre polyvalence, vous ne serez pas cantonn&eacute; a un r&ocirc;le (ou alors il y&#8217;a un probl&egrave;me) me retrouver a r&eacute;pondre au t&eacute;l&eacute;phone, faire la maintenance du r&eacute;seau, monter une table, trouver un moyen d&#8217;&ecirc;tre &agrave; 4 sur une table suppos&eacute; en accueillir 2. Mais c&#8217;est surtout le lieu parfait pour apprendre rapidement hors de votre domaine de comp&eacute;tence. Comprendre les processus de Marketing, le Taylorisme, de recrutement etc&#8230; Et en retour quel bonheur quand la personne en marketing vous parleras de ses probl&egrave;mes HTML pour envoyer sa campagne de mail !<br /><br /><strong>Des responsabilit&eacute;s</strong><br /><br />Travailler pour une startup veut probablement dire que vous faites partie d&#8217;une petite &eacute;quipe. Il n&#8217;y a pas de meilleur endroits ou votre polyvalence sera mise &agrave; l&#8217;&eacute;preuve. Vous jouerez un r&ocirc;le primordiale, participerez a la cr&eacute;ation du produit, et verrez grandir votre b&eacute;b&eacute; de jours en jours et ressentirez une tr&egrave;s grande fiert&eacute; en regardant en arri&egrave;re.<br /><br /><strong>Votre travail sera reconnu (tout comme vos &eacute;checs !)</strong><br /><br />Lorsque l&#8217;on int&egrave;gre une grosse entreprise, il y&#8217;a des chances pour que votre sup&eacute;rieur obtienne tout les fruits de votre travail ou que votre sup&eacute;rieur ignore simplement votre travail. Mais dans un environnement aussi restreint, il est quasi impossible de ne pas reconnaitre un travail bien fait. Si vous r&eacute;ussissez votre &eacute;quipe le verra instantan&eacute;ment. Ouvrez vos bras en V mes amis, votre travail a &eacute;t&eacute; reconnu ! Mais de l&#8217;autre cot&eacute; si vous faites des erreurs tout vous retomberas dessus (Pardon d&#8217;avoir spamm&eacute; vos boites mails !). Cela pr&eacute;sente un double avantage, vous serez plus vigilant pour ne pas d&eacute;cevoir vos coll&egrave;gues. Et vous ne vous rel&acirc;cherais pas, car le reste de l&#8217;&eacute;quipe se demanderas pourquoi est-ce qu&#8217;elle travaille deux fois plus dure. Restez concentr&eacute;s et vos succ&egrave;s seront mis en valeurs et vos &eacute;checs minimis&eacute;s. Et lorsque l&#8217;on vous diras &#8220;Nous n&#8217;aurions pas pu le faire sans toi&#8221; vous pouvez &ecirc;tre sure qu&#8217;ils le pensent. Appr&eacute;cier la bi&egrave;re ou le champagne offert pour l&#8217;occasion !<br /><br /><strong>Des opportunit&eacute;s</strong><br /><br />Cela vous forcera a monter en comp&eacute;tence rapidement, mais aussi apprendre &agrave; vous organiser en fonction des priorit&eacute;s, la plupart des startups adopte une m&eacute;thode AGILE. Dans une plus grosse entreprise je n&#8217;aurais probablement pas eu les m&ecirc;me opportunit&eacute;s, savoir que tous le monde compte sur le travail que j&#8217;effectue. Suis-je le membre le plus important de l&#8217;&eacute;quipe ? D&eacute;finitivement pas. Mais suis-je une partie int&eacute;grale de celle ci ? C&#8217;est certain. C&#8217;est le meilleur endroit pour prendre en gallon.<br /><br /><strong>Un &eacute;change enrichissant</strong><br /><br />Le monde de l&#8217;entrepreunariat&#8230; Vous rencontrerez des innovateurs ! Ayant une perception totalement diff&eacute;rentes, une fa&ccedil;on de pens&eacute;e &agrave; part enti&egrave;re de r&eacute;soudre les probl&egrave;mes. Il y&#8217;a beaucoup &agrave; apprendre de ces personnes qui d&eacute;cident de cr&eacute;er quelquechose. Ce challenge permanent se transmettras &agrave; vous, ainsi que leurs persistances. Toutes les startups se forment autour d&#8217;un noyau et il y&#8217;a beaucoup a apprendre de ce noyau pour peu que l&#8217;on prenne le temps de l&#8217;observer !<br /><br /><strong>Une atmosph&egrave;re funky !</strong><br /><br />M&ecirc;me si toutes les startups ont leurs petites traditions voila ce qui est le plus r&eacute;current :<br />&nbsp;- Venez comme vous &ecirc;tes ! Aucun dresscode<br />&nbsp;- Beaucoup de rires !<br />&nbsp;- Nous sommes tous anim&eacute;s par le m&ecirc;me but, l&#8217;esprit entrepreneurial est contagieux !<br />&nbsp;- Vous pouvez boire des bi&egrave;res au travail ! Mais seulement pour les occasions sp&eacute;ciales&#8230; Je vous fais confiance pour trouver beaucoup d&rsquo;occasions sp&eacute;ciales ! Wink.</p>

Ayant seulement fait du d&eacute;veloppement web sur du php auparavant. J&#8217;ai voulu m&#8217;essayer &agrave; un langage de programmation orient&eacute;e objet.

<!-- more -->


<ol>
<li><p>OU (OR)
Google fait normalement une recherche sur l’ensemble des mots clés que vous lui fournissez. Néanmoins en utilisant le symbole “|” ( Pipe ) il est possible de demander a faire une recherche sur un mot ou un autre voir les deux.</p>

<p>  ex : blog | philippe | tring</p></li>
<li><p>Guillemets
Si vous recherchez une phrase exact, utilisez des guillemets.</p>

<p>  ex : “blog philippe tring” ou blog “philippe tring” rechercheras le mot blog ainsi que la suite de mots “philippe tring”</p></li>
<li><p>NON (NOT)
Si vous souhaitez que google ne prenne pas en compte les pages ayant certains mots, précédais les d’un tiret “-“</p>

<p>  ex : -blog philippe tring</p></li>
<li><p>Mots similaires
En utilisant le tilde “~” vous ferez une recherche sur des mots ayant la même signification.</p>

<p>  ex : ~bonheur philippe tring</p></li>
<li><p>Wildcard
Le symbole “*” fait office de joker. Il remplace n’importe quel mots très utile si vous recherchez les paroles d’une chanson.</p>

<p>  ex : “We all live in a * submarine” vous retournera les paroles de la chanson des Beatles</p></li>
<li><p>Definition
Pour avoir une définition d’un mot précédais le de “definition:” ou “define:”</p>

<p>  ex : define:bonheur</p></li>
<li><p>Google recherche avancée
Si vous n’arrivez pas a vous rappeler de tout ses mots vous pouvez utiliser l’outil de recherche avancée de google <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search">http://www.google.com/advanced_search</a></p></li>
<li><p>Calculatrice
Vous pouvez vous servir de google comme d’une calculatrice</p></li>
<li><p>Intervalle de nombre
Cette fonctionnalitée peu connue permet de faire une recherche sur un intervalle de nombre</p>

<p>  ex : 1992..2014 nobel</p></li>
<li><p>Site spécifique
Pour concentrer votre recherche sur un site unique utilisez le mot “site:”</p>

<p>  ex : site:philippetring.fr blog</p></li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Plein d’entrain et d’espoir vous avez envoyé 1001 lettres de motivations et CV. Mais aucune ne vous a répondu, car vous n’avez <strong>aucune expérience</strong> professionnelle dans le domaine.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Dans un contexte ou les entreprises sont de plus en plus sollicitées, par mails, téléphone, lettres de motivations plus géniales les unes que les autres (ou pas..), comment se <strong>démarquer des autres</strong> ? Le moyen le plus simple de rentrer dans une entreprise est de connaitre une personne déjà présente dans l’entreprise. (Cf : <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston" title="Lien wikipédia">Piston</a>, avantage obtenu grâce à l’appui de certaines relations dans une entreprise ou administration.). Et si demain la personne pistonnée c’était vous ?</p>

<p>Avant de débuter cet article il est important de rappeler la notion d’opportunité. Une opportunité est une occasion favorable. Dans notre cas favorable à la recherche d’entreprise et plus précisément la rencontre d’une relation pouvant nous amener à trouver notre entreprise. Alors, comment rencontrer notre Messie ?</p>

<p>Le networking, mais c’est quoi ? Beaucoup utilisé dans le monde de l’entrepreneuriat ce terme signifie simplement le fait d’agrandir son réseau.</p>

<p>Nous savons qui nous voulons rencontrer, mais où le faire ? Je précise que j’habite en région parisienne. Il y a donc tous les jours (Il suffit de chercher un peu) des conférences, meetup, rencontres organisées à propos de technologies, ou de façon informelle dans des cafés.</p>

<p>L’intérêt en plus de rencontrer de potentielles relations est de partager avec des inconnus son expérience, on y fait plein de rencontres plus intéressantes les unes que les autres ! En plus d’enrichir ses connaissances !</p>

<p>Vous voila seul entouré de plein d’inconnus, comment entamer la conversation ? Je vous révèle ma phrase magique : « Bonjour (Sourire, en regardant la personne dans les yeux), c’est la première fois que tu viens à un événement pareil ? »</p>

<p>Ensuite, à vous de jouer, car je le rappel, le meilleur moyen d’avoir des opportunités dans la vie, c’est d’en être une soi-même.</p>

<p>Bonne année 2014, en vous souhaitant pleins de jolies rencontres, Philippe.</p>

<p>Bonus, une liste non exhaustive de sites qui organisent ces meetings (N’hésitez pas à m’envoyer vos sites <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#112;&#104;&#105;&#x6c;&#105;&#112;&#x70;&#101;&#x74;&#x72;&#105;&#110;&#x67;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">&#112;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#x69;&#112;&#x70;&#101;&#116;&#x72;&#105;&#110;&#x67;&#64;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>)</p>
